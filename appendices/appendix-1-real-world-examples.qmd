#### **1. Make Data Governance Explicit to Support Trust and Reuse**

Clear governance defines roles, responsibilities, and procedures ensuring data quality, long-term maintenance, accountability, and compliance with community principles such as FAIR and CARE. Effective governance fosters trust, and facilitate data sharing, reduces ambiguity regarding decision making, and is critical for coordinating both technical and sociocultural aspects of data stewardship.

In collaborative international or multi-organizational settings, establishing governance at the outset of a project is crucial for aligning diverse groups, including biologists, data managers, Indigenous communities, policymakers, and other participants. Early governance planning should establish clear, collaborative frameworks that respect each group’s expertise and needs from the beginning. 

##### Practical Applications:

1.1 Document roles and responsibilities clearly at project start using a Project or Data Product Governance Charter and structured frameworks (e.g., DACI or RACI charts) that relate to organizational data policies.

-   [Example of a Data Management Plan from the California Department of Water Resources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Br-Johnson/sdm-paper/refs/heads/main/examples/Cal_DMP.pdf)

-   Data Management Plan Templates from [DMPTool](https://dmptool.org/public_templates?page=ALL), and [NOAA Data Management Handbook](https://www.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-03/NAO_212-15B_-_Data_Management_Handbook.pdf)

1.2 Integrate CARE principles to ensure ethical governance and respect Indigenous data rights.

-   Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission use password protected website to host all the WDFW and tribal data in a one-stop shopping website for co-managers to pull data they need for decision-making process. <https://fisheriesservices.nwifc.org/>

1.3 Create a governance or oversight committee for regular data practice reviews and decision making regarding data structures, timelines, data sharing agreements and interoperability protocols

-   Pacific Salmon Commission has formed a Technical Committee on Data Sharing including both US and Canadian data contributors. <https://www.psc.org/membership-lists/>

#### **2. Reuse Proven Infrastructure to Save Time and Increase Interoperability**

Building custom solutions should be avoided where possible. Maximizing existing platforms and technologies reduces costs, accelerates implementation, and increases data interoperability. Building modular, interoperable systems grounded in proven technologies ensures sustainable long-term stewardship.

##### Practical Applications:

2.1 [Use the Ocean Biodiversity Information System or the Global Biodiversity Information Facility to standardize and host your data](https://doi.org/10.14286/duc6mu)

2.2 Use free data catalogue services such as the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB) or Zenodo

-   The Pacific Salmon Foundation’s [spawner surveys dataset on Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14194638) (Carturan and Peacock 2025) received more views within weeks than a [analogous dataset in the Salmon Data Library](https://data.salmonwatersheds.ca/result?datasetid=2) (Pacific Salmon Foundation 2025) did over several years, illustrating that leveraging established public data infrastructures, rather than developing institution-specific ones, can substantially increase discoverability.

#### **3. Make Data, People, Projects, and Outputs Discoverable, Linked and Citable with PIDs**

Persistent identifiers (PIDs), including Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) are essential for tracking the provenance and reuse of data, and linking data, protocols, organizations and people. They allow for consistent referencing, integration across systems, and automated credit via data citation.

##### Practical Applications:

3.1 Encourage researchers to register for an [Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID)](https://orcid.org/) and include ORCIDs in metadata records and submission forms

3.2 Register your organization with the Research Organization Registry (ROR) and use ROR IDs to identify institutions involved in salmon science.

-   Several salmon data holding institutions are already [registered with ROR](https://ror.org/search?page=1&query=salmon). As a result, those organizations can track and demonstrate their scholarly impact from data publications: [DataCite Commons: Pacific Salmon Foundation](https://commons.datacite.org/ror.org/04901nj56)

3.3 Assign DOIs to data packages, protocols, and reports using DataCite. Maintain version history for all metadata records and document the provenance of metadata creation, updates, and quality control processes to ensure accountability and traceability.

-   The North Pacific Anadromous FIsh Commission (NPAFC) assigns DOIs to IYS-related data packages which are served by a CKAN catalogue at <https://data.npafc.org>. The Commission also assigns DOIs to NPAFC Technical Reports and Bulletins.
-   The Pacific Salmon Foundation’s State of Salmon report (stateofsalmon.ca) has unique DOIs for each version, improving specificity and citability of each year’s results.

3.4 Embed DOIs in dashboards, figures, and metadata so they persist in derivative products.

#### **4. Use Shared Data Models, Vocabularies and Metadata to Enable Integration**

Standardizing metadata and terminology ensures data can be interpreted correctly and integrated across systems. Controlled vocabularies, community ontologies, and structured metadata schemas allow data to retain its full semantic meaning.

##### Practical Applications:

4.1 Configure data catalogues and metadata intake tools to accept internationally recognized metadata schemas such as ISO 19115, Ecological Metadata Language (EML), or DataCite. Implement automated validation against schema requirements and manual review processes to ensure metadata completeness, accuracy, and consistency before publication.

-   The Pacific Salmon Foundation's data portal asks contributors to provide metadata in ISO 19115 or other standard formats. [[marinedata.psf.ca]{.underline}](https://marinedata.psf.ca/data/data-submission-form/#:~:text=){alt="https://marinedata.psf.ca/data/data-submission-form/#:~:text="}, ensuring consistent metadata structure
-   The NPAFC uses ISO 19115 metadata standard in their data catalogue https://data.npafc.org

4.2 Model datasets and databases using the [Darwin Core Standard](https://dwc.tdwg.org/)

-   The Hakai Institute Juvenile Salmon Program publishes their data to OBIS using Darwin Core: [Hakai Institute Juvenile Salmon Program](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/72de3af4-1572-4f2d-8006-2bfa2007065c)

-   The International Year of the Salmon High Seas Expeditions data mobilization efforts [@johnson2024] published their data to OBIS: <https://www.gbif.org/dataset/search?project_id=IYS>

-   StreamNet’s Data Exchange Standard (DES) provides a concrete example of collaboratively developed data exchange rules (structures, definitions, and business rules) for fish monitoring and related data [@streamnet_des_2024_1].

4.3 Re-use or publish data terms that are shared online using a persistent identifier in a controlled vocabulary or ontology

-   The DFO Salmon Ontology publishes stable identifiers and definitions for salmon-domain concepts to support semantic alignment and crosswalks: <https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/dfo-salmon-ontology/>

-   WDFW has definitions of all hatchery escapement data. [Hatchery escapement reports \| Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife](https://wdfw.wa.gov/fishing/management/hatcheries/escapement#definitions)

-   Fish Passage Counts has defined metadata that can be used across OFDW and WDFW. <https://www.fpc.org/111_sharedfiles/ColumbiaRiverBasinAdultFishPassageCountsMetadata.pdf>

#### **Best Practice 5: Store and Analyze Data in Ways That Others Can Easily Access, Use, and Trust**

Making data easily accessible promotes its use in research and management, enabling integration with tools and applications. Ensuring accessible, persistent data storage requires more than file hosting [@coretrustseal_2022_requirements]. Data should be structured and well-documented, stored in repositories that support long-term preservation, and---where it materially improves reuse---made available via programmatic access such as APIs.

##### Practical Applications:

5.1 Provide Direct Data Access via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) using tools such as FastAPI, Flask, or Django REST Framework that allows users to access, filter, and retrieve data programmatically, facilitating automation and integration into analytical tools and decision-support systems

-   The Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission makes their [PIT Tag Information System](https://www.psmfc.org/program/pit-tag-information-systems-ptagis) data accessible via the [PTAGIS API](https://api.ptagis.org/index.html#:~:text=PTAGIS%20API%20Gets%20a%20list,PTAGIS%20and%20currently%20contributing%20data)

5.2 Archive data in certified long-term, domain-specific repositories such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, the Federated Research Data Repository (FRDR), or NOAA’s NCEI, USGS ScienceBase, or EMODnet

-   Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF): <https://www.gbif.org/>
-   Federated Research Data Repository (FRDR): <https://frdr-dfdr.ca/>
-   NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI): <https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/>
-   USGS ScienceBase: <https://www.sciencebase.gov/>

5.3 Leverage the integration between GitHub and Zenodo to automate archiving and DOI assignment, ensuring long-term data preservation.

-   The Pacific Salmon Foundation conducted an extensive cleaning of DFO’s New Salmon Escapement Database System (NuSEDS) to maximize data recovery. The R code for this procedure is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/salmonwatersheds/population-indicators/tree/master/spawner-surveys/code), while the resulting dataset is archived on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14194638), with accompanying [R Markdown documentation](https://bookdown.org/salmonwatersheds/1_nuseds_collation/) linked on both platforms. The code and dataset are updated in parallel with NuSEDS, and each dataset version is assigned a DOI to ensure proper citation and traceability.

#### **6. Incentivize and Track Data Sharing and Reuse**

The currency of research lies in recognition—credit, citations, and opportunities for collaboration or co-authorship. Promoting data sharing requires both cultural and technical infrastructure. The cultural infrastructure requires a shift towards viewing data publication as equal in importance to article publication. The infrastructure put in place needs to support the process of generating citation records that give credit to all First Nations, Tribes, agencies, and organizations. By recognizing contributions, tracking reuse, and supporting citation, data stewards can create a system where sharing is rewarded.

##### Practical Applications:

6.1 License data for reuse using liberal licenses

-   All data accessible through the [NPAFC data catalogue](https://data.npafc.org) is licensed as  [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en)

6.2 Provide recommended citation text and visible credit fields in metadata

6.3 Create summary dashboards that highlight reuse using [COUNTER Code of Practice compliant metrics](https://www.countermetrics.org/) to track dataset views/downloads and the DataCite APIs

6.4 Ensure that datasets are properly cited in journal articles using in text citations and the recommended citation in the articles list of references, not just in a Data Availability statement

-   In late 2024, the NPAFC began citing data sets using in-text citations and the recommended citation in the list of references with the publication of NPAFC Bulletin 7 titled, *Highlights of the 2022 International Year of the Salmon Pan–Pacific Winter Expedition*.
-   The cleaned NuSEDS dataset (see Section 5.3) was used in an analysis and cited in the associated publication ([Atkinson et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2024-0387)) using the DOI and citation provided with the dataset on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15625993).

6.5 Promote the view that well documented data publications are primary research outputs and are significant contributions to the field

#### **7. Build Community Through Co-Development and Mutual Benefit**

Creating an infrastructure that standardizes and provides cross-border and cross-ecosystem data integration is only effective if there’s community engagement. Standards and tools must be co-developed with their intended users using user-centred design principles [@iso9241_210_2019] to be effective. Engaging biologists, Indigenous stewards, and data managers ensures relevance, usability, and long-term participation.

##### Practical Applications:

7.1 Participate in salmon data focused communities such as the [Research Data Alliance’s Salmon Research and Monitoring Interest Group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/salmon-research-and-monitoring-ig/) 

7.2 Run participatory workshops for metadata mapping and vocabulary alignment

-   American Fisheries Society 2025 WA-BC Chapter Annual Meeting workshop. ['Fishing for Clarity: Knowledge Modelling to Support Cross-organizational Collaboration and Data Sharing about Salmon Escapement](https://pnamp.org/event/workshop-fishing-for-clarity-knowledge-modeling-to-support-cross-organizational-collaboration-and-data-sharing-about-salmon-escapement/)

7.3 Support and follow through on Community Engaged Research (e.g. [The Salmon Prize Project](https://salmonprize.com)) that provides tangible value to the communities in which research or monitoring was conducted.
