How We Publish

Fisheries is a peer-reviewed magazine publishing 12 issues per year

online and in print.

After copyediting and review of the final proof, papers are published

on the Advance Articles page. This is the Version of Record of the

paper. The Version of Record requires a correction notice for any

changes after it is published, even if it is not yet placed in an issue.

See the definitions of the Version of Record and other versions of the

paper for more details. The Version of Record will be removed from

the Advance Articles page after it is paginated and published into an

issue.

Scope of the Magazine

Fisheries is the monthly peer-reviewed membership publication of

the American Fisheries Society (AFS), the oldest and largest

professional society representing fisheries scientists.

Fisheries features peer-reviewed technical articles on all aspects of

aquatic resource-related subjects, as well as professional issues, new

ideas and approaches, education, economics, administration, and

law. Issues contain features, essays, AFS news, current events, book

reviews, editorials, letters, job notices, chapter activities, and a

calendar of events. Its goal is to provide timely, useful, and accurate

information on fisheries science, management, and the fisheries

profession for AFS members. Some types of articles which are

suitable for Fisheries include fishery case histories, review or

synthesis articles covering a specific issue, policy articles,

perspective or opinion pieces, essays, teaching case studies, and

current events or news features. We strive to be a voice for AFS

members who have ideas and stories to share that will advance

fisheries science or AFS as a professional society.

Submitting to the Magazine

Your submission will be thoughtfully reviewed by experts with

extensive knowledge of the field, who represent one of the oldest and

https://academic.oup.com/ﬁsheries/pages/general-instructions?login=false

2/45

General Instructions | Fisheries | Oxford Academic

most trusted scientific societies with a reputation for publishing

high quality science. We appreciate your interest in submitting your

manuscript to Fisheries and look forward to working together. Learn

more about the benefits of publishing in the Magazine here.

Fisheries is an official publication of the American Fisheries Society

(AFS). To publish the Magazine, the AFS partners with Oxford

University Press (OUP), a not-for-profit publisher and a department

of the University of Oxford. Learn more about how publishing with

OUP reinvests in the scholarly community on the OUP Authoring

page.

Fisheries is one of the mostly widely read fisheries science publication

in the world. Accordingly, content submitted for consideration should

appeal broadly to fisheries professionals and speak to the interests of

the AFS membership. We particularly encourage the submission of

short-form (under 5 typeset pages) “mini-review” articles. We will

waive page charges for even shorter articles (under 2 typeset pages)

on such articles as current events in fisheries science, interviews

with fisheries scientists, history pieces, informative how-to articles,

etc. We also encourage articles that will expose our members to new

or different fields, and that recognize the varied interests of our

readers. Research articles may be considered if the work has broad

implications or applications, and the subject matter can be readily

understood by professionals of a variety of backgrounds.

Pre-submission consultations are welcomed and encouraged to

evaluate content or determine how manuscripts can be structured to

be consistent with Fisheries editorial goals. Please contact Steven

Cooke (stevencooke@cunet.carleton.ca) for pre-submission reviews.

Lengthy, highly technical, or narrowly focused research articles are

better suited to the AFS technical publications, and we encourage

authors to consider the other AFS journals as venues for these works.

Papers concerning fisheries science per se should be submitted to

Transactions of the American Fisheries Society; those dealing with

management should be submitted to the North American Journal of

Fisheries Management; those dealing with the health of fish and other

aquatic organisms should be submitted to the Journal of Aquatic

Animal Health; those dealing with aquaculture should be submitted to

https://academic.oup.com/ﬁsheries/pages/general-instructions?login=false

3/45

12/30/25, 12:29 PM

the North American Journal of Aquaculture; and those with a focus on

marine and estuarine species and habitats should be submitted

to Marine and Coastal Fisheries: Dynamics, Management, and Ecosystem

Science.

After preparing your manuscript according to the guidance in the

Manuscript elements and preparation section, you can submit your

work through the Magazine’s online submission site. If you have not

used our submission site before, you will need to create an account.

Additional help and instructions are available on the submissions site

as you go through the submission process. More information is

available on the ScholarOne Manuscripts FAQ and help page.  Please

contact us with any questions about submitting your manuscript.

Peer Review Process

Fisheries offers authors the choice of single-anonymized or double-

anonymized peer review. Authors who prefer a double-anonymized

peer review should (1) check the appropriate block on the submission

page, (2) put the title page in a separate file, and (3) remove from

their manuscript any other information that may reveal their

identities. All manuscripts must include a title page, listing all

authors’ names and affiliations. Including the title page in the main

manuscript file will share the authors’ identities with the reviewers.

Please do not provide your title page as a separate file unless you are

requesting anonymity.

In single-anonymized peer review, the identity of the authors is

known to the editors and to the reviewers, but the reviewers’

identities are known only to the editors and are hidden from the

authors.

In double-anonymized peer review, the identity of the authors is

hidden from reviewers, and the reviewers’ identities are hidden from

the authors. The editors know the identity of both the reviewers and

the authors.

Once a submitted manuscript passes a quality check from the AFS

editorial office and initial assessment by the Magazine’s Editor-in-

https://academic.oup.com/ﬁsheries/pages/general-instructions?login=false

4/45

12/30/25, 12:29 PM

General Instructions | Fisheries | Oxford Academic

Chief (EIC), it will then be passed to a chief science editor, who will

oversee peer review and make the final decision. A science editor will

select reviewers and make a recommendation to the chief science

editor. Prior to assignment to the editor, a paper may be rejected by

the EIC or editorial office if it is determined to be inappropriate or out

of scope for the Magazine, or if it needs to be substantially improved

before undergoing peer review.

Editors and reviewers must not handle manuscripts if they have a

conflict of interest with an author or the content. Editors make every

effort to avoid potential conflicts of interest in the assignment of

other editors and peer reviewers. For more information, please see

the section on Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest. During the

peer review phase, a manuscript is typically sent to two reviewers.

Authors may suggest up to 2 potential reviewers at submission.

However, there is no guarantee the suggested reviewers will be

selected by the Magazine. Recommended reviewers should be

experts in their field and able to provide an objective assessment of

the manuscript without financial or interpersonal conflicts of

interest with any authors. We encourage authors to consider

reviewers from a diverse range of backgrounds, including those from

under-represented communities.

Authors may also request that specific individuals not be used as

reviewers of a manuscript. However, there is no guarantee these

individuals will be excluded by the Magazine.

For both preferred and opposed (or excluded) reviewers, please

provide their details in the designated area in the ScholarOne

submission form.

Statistical methods should be rigorous, and reporting of statistical

findings should be accurate and complete. Editors may request an

expert statistical review of any submission containing statistical

analysis.

If a manuscript is accepted for publication, the reviewer comments

will not be published alongside the paper.

peer review, OUP author information, or contact the AFS editorial

office.

Manuscript transfer

Fisheries magazine accepts original submissions as well as transfers

to and from all other AFS publications, i.e., Transactions of the

American Fisheries Society; the North American Journal of Fisheries

Management; the North American Journal of Aquaculture; the Journal of

Aquatic Animal Health; and Marine and Coastal Fisheries: Dynamics,

Management, and Ecosystem Science.

Receiving transfers
Reviewer reports may be included in the transfer with reviewer

consent. Transferred manuscripts may be sent out for additional

peer review, and a decision will be made on the manuscript based on

the feedback from all consenting reviewers and the judgment of the

editorial team of Fisheries.

Sending transfers
In some cases, the editorial team of the Magazine may offer authors

the option of transferring their manuscript to another AFS title. If the

offer is accepted, the manuscript files and any reviewer reports from

consenting reviewers will be sent to the receiving title. The editorial

team of that title may choose to seek additional peer review. A

decision will be made on the manuscript based on the feedback from

all reviewers and the judgment of the receiving title’s editorial team.

Screening for misconduct

Manuscripts will be screened at submission using iThenticate to help

detect publication misconduct including plagiarism and redundant

publication.

Reviewer recognition

To promote recognition of the essential work done by reviewers, the

Magazine offers reviewers the option to have their reviews verified

and automatically listed on their Web of Science Researcher Profile

and/or their ORCID iD profile.

Reviewer locator

The Magazine uses the Web of Science Reviewer Locator to assist the

editors in finding appropriate reviewers.

Appeals and complaints

Authors may request reconsideration of rejected papers when they

believe that the review process was flawed in some way (e.g.,

suspicion of bias or inadequate understanding of the paper on the

part of the reviewers and/or the associate editor). Such requests

should be directed to the EIC or AFS editorial office and should

include a detailed statement as to why the paper should be

reconsidered along with supporting material as necessary. They

should also indicate the author’s preferred remedy, which may range

from a simple re-examination of the reviews and recommendation

by the original editor to a completely fresh review by a new chief

science editor, science editor, and reviewers. Decisions about

requests for reconsideration will be made by the managing editor in

consultation with the original editor and/or the EIC and publications

director. Every effort will be made to give authors a fair hearing.

Please do not resubmit the manuscript in the interim.

To register a complaint regarding non-editorial decisions, the

Magazine’s policies and procedures, editors, or staff, please contact

us. Complaints will be taken seriously and will be carried forward

following Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines and

processes and/or sanctions will be enacted if deemed appropriate.

Publication and Research Ethics

Authorship

Authorship is limited to those who have made a significant

contribution to the design and execution of the work described. Any

contributors whose participation does not meet the criteria for

authorship should be acknowledged but not listed as an author. The

Magazine will contact all listed authors at the point of submission to

confirm their role. For a detailed definition of authorship, please see

the Ethical Guidelines for Publication of Fisheries Research.

The Magazine does not allow ghost authorship, where an unnamed

author prepares the article with no credit, or guest/gift authorship,

where an author who made little or no contribution is listed as an

author. The Magazine follows COPE guidance on investigating and

resolving these cases. For more information, please see the OUP

Publication Ethics page.

Natural language processing tools driven by artificial intelligence

(AI) do not qualify as authors, and the Magazine will screen for them

in author lists. The use of AI (for example, to help generate content,

write code, or process data) should be disclosed during submission

and in the Methods or Acknowledgments section of manuscripts.

Please see the COPE position statement on Authorship and AI for

more details.

After manuscript submission, no authorship changes (including the

authorship list, author order, and who is designated as the

corresponding author) should be made without clearly noting any

such changes in the point-by-point response to the decision letter.

All co-authors must agree on the change(s), and neither the

Magazine nor the publisher mediates such disputes. If individuals

cannot agree on the authorship of a submitted manuscript, contact

the editorial office. The dispute must be resolved among the

individuals and their institution(s) before the manuscript can be

accepted for publication. If an authorship dispute or change arises

after a paper is accepted, contact OUP’s Author Support team. COPE

provides guidance for authors on resolving authorship disputes.

https://academic.oup.com/ﬁsheries/pages/general-instructions?login=false

12/30/25, 12:29 PM

General Instructions | Fisheries | Oxford Academic

If authors intend to use Read and Publish funding to publish a

manuscript under an open access license, note that changing the

corresponding author to access those funds is not permissible. For

more information on Read and Publish funding, see the open access

charges section.

ORCID iD
Authors are encouraged to provide their ORCID iDs (Open Researcher

and Contributor IDs) at submission and take advantage of the

benefits of participating in ORCID. If authors do not already have an

ORCID iD, they can register for free via the ORCID website.

As ORCID identifiers are collected, they are included in papers and

displayed online, both in the HTML and PDF versions of the

publication. ORCID functionality online allows users to link to the

ORCID website to view an author’s profile and list of publications.

ORCID iDs are displayed on web pages and are sent downstream to

third parties in data feeds, where supported.

Group Authorship
Groups (also known as corporate, organization, or collective names)

who meet authorship criteria should be included in the main author

list. Every individual in the group should fully meet the criteria for

authorship. At least one individual must be designated on behalf of

the group as the primary point of contact during the peer-review and

production processes, as well as for correspondence following

publication. You may list this individual separately in the main

author list if desired. A complete list of the individual members of the

group must be included in the manuscript under the

Acknowledgments heading.

Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest

Authors
The Magazine requires all authors to disclose any potential conflicts

of interest at the point of submission. It is the responsibility of the

corresponding author to ensure that conflicts of interest of all

authors are declared to the Magazine. Conflicts of interest should be

https://academic.oup.com/ﬁsheries/pages/general-instructions?login=false

9/45

12/30/25, 12:29 PM

General Instructions | Fisheries | Oxford Academic

included in the ScholarOne submission form as well as in a separate

section with the heading “Conflicts of Interest.” If there are no

interests to disclose, this section should state “none declared”. See

Manuscript elements and preparation section below.

A conflict of interest exists when the position, activities, or

relationships of an individual, whether direct or indirect, financial or

non-financial, could influence or be seen to influence the opinions or

activities of the individual. For more information, refer to OUP’s

definition of conflicts of interest. The Magazine follows the COPE

guidance for any undisclosed conflicts of interest that emerges

during peer review, production, or after publication.

Peer reviewers
Individuals that have a conflict of interest relating to a submitted

manuscript should recuse themselves and will not be assigned to

oversee, handle, or peer review the manuscript.

If during peer review an editor, reviewer, or author becomes aware of

a conflict of interest that was not previously known or disclosed they

must inform the EIC immediately.

Editors and editorial board members
At initial submission, the corresponding author must declare if the

EIC, an editor, or an editorial board member of the Magazine is an

author of or contributor to the manuscript. Another editor without a

conflict of interest will oversee the peer review and decision-making

process. If accepted, a statement will be published in the paper

describing how the manuscript was handled. The statement will read

“[Author name] holds the position of [role] for [Magazine] and has

not peer reviewed or made any editorial decisions for this paper." If

the authors opt for a double-anonymized review they may also note

that here.

Previously published material

Authors should only submit a manuscript(s) to the Magazine if:

It is original work by the author and their co-author(s).

It contains nothing abusive, defamatory, derogatory, obscene,

fraudulent, or illegal.

The editorial office may request the submitting author provide

copies of all related or similar preprints, dissertations, manuscripts,

published papers, and reports by the same authors (i.e., those

containing substantially similar content or using the same, similar,

or a subset of data) that have been previously published or posted

electronically or are under consideration elsewhere at the time of

manuscript submission. Authors may be required to provide a

concise explanation of how the submitted manuscript differs from

these related manuscripts and papers. All related previously

published papers should be cited as references and described in the

submitted manuscript.

For previously published materials including tables and figures,

please see the Reusing copyrighted materials section.

Preprints
Authors retain the right to make an Author’s Original Version

(preprint) available through various channels and this does not

prevent submission to the Magazine. If accepted, the authors are

required to update the status of any preprint, including adding a

published paper’s DOI. For full details on allowed channels and

updating a preprint, please see our Author self-archiving policy.

Reusing copyrighted material

Authors must obtain permission for any material used within a

manuscript for which they are not the rightsholder, including

quotations, tables, figures, images, data, or software. In seeking

permissions for published materials, first contact the publisher

rather than the author. For unpublished materials, start by

contacting the creator. Copies of each grant of permission should be

agreement must include the following:

Nonexclusive rights to reproduce the material in the paper in

Fisheries

Rights for use in print and electronic format at a minimum, and

preferably for use in any form or medium

Lifetime rights to use the material

Worldwide English-language rights

If authors have chosen to publish under an open access license but

have not obtained open access re-use permissions for third-party

material contained within the manuscript, this must be stated clearly

by supplying a credit line alongside the material with the following

information:

Title of content

This image/content is not covered by the terms of the Creative

Commons license of this publication. For permission to reuse,

please contact the rights holder.

Our publisher, Oxford University Press, provides detailed Copyright

and Permissions Guidelines, and a summary of the fundamental

information.

Misconduct

Authors should observe high standards with respect to research

integrity and publication ethics as set out by the COPE. Falsification

or fabrication of data including inappropriate image manipulation,

plagiarism, including duplicate publication of the author's own work

without proper citation, and misappropriation of work are all

unacceptable practices.  Allegations of ethical misconduct, both

directly and through social media, are treated seriously and will be

investigated in accordance with the relevant COPE guidance.

https://academic.oup.com/ﬁsheries/pages/general-instructions?login=false

General Instructions | Fisheries | Oxford Academic

If misconduct has been established beyond reasonable doubt, this

may result in one or more of the following outcomes, among others:

If a submitted manuscript is still under consideration, it may be

rejected and returned to the author.

If a paper has already been published online, depending on the

nature and severity of the infraction, either a correction notice

will be published and linked to the paper, or retraction of the

paper will occur, following the COPE Retraction Guidelines.

The relevant party’s institution(s) and/or other publications may

be informed.

COPE defines plagiarism as “when somebody presents the work of

others (data, words or theories) as if they were their own and without

proper acknowledgment.”

COPE defines redundant/overlapping publication as “when a

published work (or substantial sections from a published work) is/are

published more than once (in the same or another language) without

adequate acknowledgment of the source/cross-

referencing/justification, or when the same (or substantially

overlapping) data is presented in more than one publication without

adequate cross-referencing/justification, particularly when this is

done in such a way that reviewers/readers are unlikely to realize that

most or all the findings have been published before.”

COPE defines citation manipulation as “behaviors intended to inflate

citation counts for personal gain, such as: excessive self-citation of

an authors’ own work, excessive citation to the journal publishing

the citing article, and excessive citation between journals in a

coordinated manner.”

Data fabrication is defined as intentionally creating fake data or

misrepresenting research results. An example includes making up

data sets.

Data falsification is defined as manipulating research data with the

purpose of intentionally giving a false representation. This can apply

to images, research materials, equipment, or processes. Examples

https://academic.oup.com/ﬁsheries/pages/general-instructions?login=false

13/45

12/30/25, 12:29 PM

General Instructions | Fisheries | Oxford Academic

include cropping of gels/images to change context and omission of

selected data.

If notified of a potential breach of research misconduct or publication

ethics, the Magazine editor and editorial office staff may inform OUP

and/or the author’s institutional affiliation(s).

Ethical research

The Magazine follows COPE guidelines on ethical oversight. We take

research integrity seriously, and all research published in the

Magazine must have been conducted in a fair and ethical manner.

Wherever appropriate, the Magazine requires that all research be

done according to international and local guidelines.

Animal subjects
Studies involving animals require approval from the relevant

institutional ethics committee or institutional animal use and care

committee, and the research must be conducted in accordance with

applicable national and international guidelines. For investigators in

the United States, AFS has developed Guidelines for the Use of Fishes in

Research, which addresses both field and laboratory research with

fish. Following the Acknowledgments, all peer reviewed manuscripts

must include a separate “Ethics Statement” section providing details

of the name of the committee(s) that approved the study, as well as

the permit or animal license numbers where available. Where a study

has been granted an exemption, this must be stated along with the

name of the authorizing body. Please be prepared to provide further

information to the editorial office upon request.

ARRIVE guidelines
Authors are encouraged to consult the ARRIVE guidelines

recommended by the National Centre for the Replacement,

Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3R).

Euthanasia or anaesthesia methods
Where applicable, any euthanasia or anesthesia methods must be

carried out in accordance with applicable veterinary guidelines.

Manuscript Submission Guide

Peer-reviewed article types

This magazine publishes several different article types. Individual

manuscript elements are described in greater detail below.

Fisheries manuscripts are typically less than 4,500 words (excluding

references, photos, figures, tables, pull quotes, titles, translations,

etc.); however, that limit is flexible. Longer papers are also

considered, provided they are of broad relevance to our community.

One full page of article text with absolutely no figures, tables, pull

quotes, titles, headers, translations, or photos is approximately 880

words or 6,100 characters including spaces. Please adhere to this

standard, taking figures and other non-text content into

consideration, when preparing manuscripts for submission

to Fisheries. Please consult the Managing Editor prior to submission

for a length or reference limit exemption for review articles or

articles of Society-wide significance.

Feature and Perspective—recommended maximum word
count: 4,500
Features are research articles reporting on original research on topics

of broad interest to our readership that address contemporary issues

and problems in all aspects of fisheries science, management, and

policy. Articles on fisheries ecology and aquatic resource

management; biology of fishes, including physiology, culture,

genetics, disease, and others; economics and social issues;

educational/administrative concepts, controversies, techniques,

philosophies, and developments; and other general interest,

fisheries-oriented subjects will be considered.

Perspectives are similar manuscripts to Features but offer new

proposals for critical evaluations of contemporary concepts,

paradigms, and ideas. They must include required elements such as

an abstract, etc., but need not otherwise follow a traditional

manuscript structure.

Each piece must include:

Title page

Abstract

Acknowledgments

Conflicts of Interest

Ethics Statement

Essay—recommended maximum word count: 2,000
Essays are thought-provoking or opinion articles based upon sound

science. Essays may cover a wide range of topics, including

professional, conservation, research, AFS, political, management, and

other issues. Essays may be submitted in conjunction with a full

feature article on the same topic. They may include photographs or

illustrations and should not cite more than eight references.

However, essays should provide scientific documentation, unlike

unreviewed opinion pieces (below). Essays are peer-reviewed based

on the following criteria: contribution to the ongoing debate, logical

opinion based on good science, persuasiveness, and clarity of

writing. Reviewer agreement with the opinion of the views

expressed is not a criterion.

Essays do not have abstracts and there is no publication fee.

Abstracts are only required for Features and Perspectives.

Acknowledgments
Authors of all article types are required to submit an

“Acknowledgments” section at the end of the manuscript in which

authors may thank those who contributed directly to the project or

the preparation of the manuscript.

Acknowledgments may include a list of participants, investigators, or

study groups within a group study; mention of previous

presentations of the material; preprint information; additional

contributions or thanks; contributions to the paper that do not

qualify for authorship (see Authorship section for additional detail);

deceased author details; and/or miscellaneous acknowledgments.

Dedications and acknowledgment of emotional support from family

and friends are not appropriate. If all authors are employees of the

U.S. Government, this section should state that the mention of

specific products does not constitute endorsement by their agency.

Conflicts of Interest
Authors of all article types are required to submit a “Conflicts of

Interest” section at the end of the manuscript which should describe

any conflicts of interest. For more information, please refer to OUP’s

definition of conflict of interest and the Authors’ section of the

potential conflicts of interest section.

If no conflicts exist, the authors should still include the section and

state “None declared.”

Data Availability
Though not required, authors of peer-reviewed article types are

strongly encouraged to submit a “Data Availability” section at the

end of the manuscript, which should identify the presence or absence

of shared data. When data have been shared, indicate how they may

be accessed. If sharing data compromises ethical standards or legal

requirements, authors are not expected to share them.

Ethics Statement
Authors of all article types are required to submit an “Ethics

Statement” section at the end of the manuscript confirming that the

research meets the ethical guidelines and legal requirements of the

country in which it was performed, and indicate the guidelines

followed.

Funding
Authors of all article types are required to submit a “Funding”

section at the end of the manuscript fully declaring all funding

information relevant to the study, including specific grant numbers.

If the funder is listed in the Crossref Open Funder Registry, the

funder name should be included exactly as it appears within that

database. Where grants were received by specific members of the

author group, the authors should be identified using closed initials

with dots (C.J.D.). If no funding was received for the study, the authors

should still include the section and state “None declared.”

Manuscript structure
Note: the majority of magazine content does not require this

structure.

Introduction

The introduction should provide a context for the work to be

reported, particularly its purpose and importance. In doing so, it

should present at least a summary review of previous literature on

the subject.

Methods

Descriptions of the methods employed in the study should be

detailed enough to enable readers to repeat it. Previously published

descriptions may be cited in lieu of presenting complete new ones

provided that the sources are readily available (in general, avoid

citations to theses, dissertations, agency reports, and similar sources

in this instance). If more than one method was used or a particular

method entails a series of major steps, present each method or step

in a separate subsection. Appropriate tables and figures can reduce

https://academic.oup.com/ﬁsheries/pages/general-instructions?login=false

31/45

12/30/25, 12:29 PM

General Instructions | Fisheries | Oxford Academic

the need for detailed verbal descriptions of methods. Papers focusing

entirely on techniques or models do not require a separate section on

methods.

Results

As a rule, it is preferable to present detailed results in tables and/or

figures and to devote the text to summary statements and analyses.

Display data in tables if numerical precision is important, in figures if

trends are paramount. Although the presentation of a large amount

of raw data is generally not meaningful, data should not be refined to

the point that the reader cannot verify the analyses or use the

information for other purposes. See the Data availability

statement section for more information.

In presenting the results of statistical tests, report the type of test,

the test statistic, the degrees of freedom, and the significance level

(p-value). Although the value 0.05 is commonly used as the threshold

in hypothesis testing, we have no specific requirements in this area;

in the interest of providing useful information, authors should report

all p-values. It is very important that statistical designs and models

be appropriate for the studies in which they are used; we encourage

authors to have a statistician review their work before submitting a

paper for publication. Lastly, statistical results should be presented in

biologically meaningful terms rather than in purely statistical

jargon.

Discussion

The merits of a paper can be greatly enhanced by a good discussion.

In it, authors should indicate the significance of their research, how it

relates to current knowledge, and any avenues that it suggests for

further research. Informed speculation is acceptable as long as it is

clearly identified as such. Authors should avoid merely restating their

results and/or (re)summarizing the literature.

References
References should be selected with a view to relevance and

availability, with preference given to peer-reviewed publications that

are widely available.

https://academic.oup.com/ﬁsheries/pages/general-instructions?login=false

32/45

12/30/25, 12:29 PM

General Instructions | Fisheries | Oxford Academic

Authors should format their references in APA style. Authors are

responsible for the accuracy of reference information and may be

queried to provide any missing reference elements during proofing.

Style files for the APA reference manager are available here.

Tables
Tables should be designed to present related information as simply

and directly as possible. Authors must number all tables (e.g., table 1,

table 2, table 3) and reference them within the text in chronological

order. Tables should be supplied in an editable format (such as

Microsoft Word or Excel), and not embedded as an image file. The use

of color and shading is not allowed, as it cannot be replicated in the

online full-text version. Ensure that any formatting or symbols such

as asterisks are explained in the table footnote. Provide units in

column or row headers, rather than in the table body.

Captions should provide enough information that readers can

easily perceive the tables’ purpose and structure (if there is more

than one table with the same general structure, the captions to

the latter ones can be shortened by referring the reader to the first

such table for details). Captions should not merely list the

contents of tables in a mechanical way.

There should be only one set of column headings. If the

information to be presented seems to require more than that, the

table should be redesigned (e.g., by switching the rows and

columns) or split into two or more tables.

Bold, centered headings may be used within the body of the table

to distinguish different types of data as long as they do not

conflict with the column headings. Such labels should be used in

place of “A,” B,” etc. designations.

Significant differences should be indicated by lowercase letters,

beginning with the letter “z” (“z” may mark either the highest or

the lowest value[s], but subsequent letters have to follow suit); in

most cases, there should be no omissions in the sequence of the

letters. The letters should be set on the same lines as the values to

which they pertain (not as superscripts) and be separated from

those values by single spaces.

https://academic.oup.com/ﬁsheries/pages/general-instructions?login=false

33/45

12/30/25, 12:29 PM

General Instructions | Fisheries | Oxford Academic

Values less than 1.00 should be preceded by zeroes (e.g., 0.78).

Values need not be reported to all significant digits if a lesser

number of digits conveys the information in a meaningful way.

Footnotes should be indicated by superscripted lowercase letters,

beginning with the letter “a”; the letters may appear in the row

and column headings as well as the body of the table but not in

the caption. The footnotes per se should be listed on separate

lines at the bottom of the table.

Figures
Figures include visual materials such as graphs, maps, diagrams, and

photographs. At the most fundamental level, figure design should

follow certain commonsense principles: figures should be as simple

and straightforward as possible; have a high enough resolution to be

easily readable; and be consistent in the use of lettering, line widths,

and other graphic elements. To ensure the highest quality, figures

should be submitted as separate files rather than being imbedded in

text files.

Authors must include figure titles, legends, and captions within the

manuscript file; they should not be included with the uploaded

image files. To the extent possible, panel descriptions, (full) variable

names, units of measure, legends, and so forth should be included in

the figure itself rather than in the caption; they should not be given

in both places. Different panels may be designated “A,” “B,” and so

forth, but it is preferable to give them substantive labels (e.g.,

“Treatment” and “Control”).

Figure files should be named simply to match their citation (e.g.,

fig1.tiff or figure2.eps). Authors should aim to submit each figure as

an individual file. If possible, submit all panels of a multi-panel figure

as one single figure file. Each panel should be labelled with a single

capital letter (e.g., A, B, C, D—no brackets or periods) in the upper-left

corner of each panel.

Figures should be submitted in one of the following file formats:

.jpeg, .jpg, .png, .tiff, .pdf, or .eps. Images prepared as .bmp, .gif, or

.doc/.docx files will not be accepted.

General Instructions | Fisheries | Oxford Academic

Images of maps, charts, graphs, shapes, and diagrams are best

rendered digitally as geometric forms called vector graphics. Vector

images use mathematical relationships between points and the lines

connecting them to describe an image. Because these file types do

not use pixels, resolution does not apply to vector images. Save

vector images as .eps or .pdf files and embed the fonts.

Images of photographs, paintings, or scans can be provided as raster

images. Raster images should be saved as uncompressed .tiff files to

avoid quality loss; .jpg/.png file formats are acceptable for raster

images but may result in a lower resolution. The resolution of raster

files is measured by the number of dots or pixels in a given area,

referred to as “dpi” or “ppi.”

Minimum resolution required for color half-tones: 300 dpi

Minimum resolution for grayscale half-tones: 600 dpi

Minimum resolution for combination half-tones and line art:

600-900 dpi

Minimum resolution for monochrome line art (complex or finely

drawn): 1,200 dpi

Please also consider accessibility when designing each figure, so that

all images can be easily understood by color-blind and visually-

impaired readers. Guidelines for preparing different image-types,

including recommendations for color palettes, color contrast, image

layout, and text accessibility.

Figure accessibility and alt text
Incorporating alt text (alternative text) when submitting your paper

helps to foster inclusivity and accessibility. Good alt text ensures that

individuals with visual impairments or those using screen readers

can comprehend the content and context of your figures. The aim of

alt text is to provide concise and informative descriptions of your

figure so that all readers have access to the same level of information

and understanding, and that all can engage with and benefit from

the visual elements integral to scholarly content. Including alt text

demonstrates a commitment to accessibility and enhances the

overall impact and reach of your work.

Alt text is applicable to all images, figures, illustrations, and

photographs.

Alt text is only accessible via e-reader and so it won’t appear as part

of the typeset article.

Detailed guidance on how to draft and submit alt text.

Graphical abstracts
Authors of Features and Perspectives are encouraged to submit a

graphical abstract as part of the article, in addition to the text

abstract. The graphical abstract should clearly summarize the focus

and findings of the article and will be published as part of the article

online and in the PDF. Any submitted graphical abstracts will

automatically be used as the “featured image” for the piece, unless an

alternate featured image has been indicated by the author.

The graphical abstract should be submitted for peer review as a

separate file, selecting the appropriate file-type designation in the

magazine’s online submission system. The file should be clearly

named, e.g., graphical_abstract.tiff. See this page for guidance on

appropriate file format and resolution for graphics.

Lay summary
When appropriate, authors are encouraged to submit a lay summary

as part of the article. Provide a brief, nontechnical statement that

clearly summarizes the focus and findings of the submission for

non-expert readers. It should explain the importance of this work in

general terms by relating it to people's lives or the environment. In

essence, answering the question, “so what?” Avoid using scientific

names and other jargon. Consider the audience, and present one or

two key take-home messages that you'd like to communicate. Limit

the statement to no more than 280 characters. The lay summary will

be published as part of the article online and in the PDF. It should be

submitted as part of the main manuscript file.

Featured images
When appropriate, authors are encouraged to submit a featured

image, also known as a teaser image or TOC image, as part of the

article. The featured image may be an interesting or dynamic figure

selected from the article or can be an image not included in the

article itself. It is presented under the article title in the online Table

of Contents (or Advance Access listing) to entice the reader to click

through to the article. The featured image can be submitted as a

separate file, selecting the appropriate file-type designation in the

Magazine’s online submission system. The file should be clearly

named, e.g., featured_image.tiff. See this page for guidance on

appropriate file format and resolution for graphics. The author

should indicate in the submission system which image (if any)

should be presented as the featured image for their article.

Appendices
Closely related material that will be of interest to a large number of

readers may be included in an appendix. Appendix material should

be regarded as an extension of the article and will be copyedited.

Appendices should be used sparingly and may be disallowed due to

space constraints in the Magazine. Authors are encouraged to

convert appendices to supplementary material when possible.

Supplementary material
Supplementary material should enhance the written article without

being necessary to understand it. Any Supplement must be cited in

the text of the main manuscript. Supplements may be presented in

any format that is suitable for their contents and will not be

copyedited. Therefore, authors should ensure that any Supplements

are ready to publish as-is if accepted. Authors must submit

supplementary data or supplementary material with the manuscript.

Style and formatting of supplementary material should be

consistent with that of the manuscript.

Supplementary material should be formatted to function on any

internet browser.

Supplementary items should be submitted as clearly-labeled files

that are separate from the main article file(s).

Supplementary material may be hosted on OUP’s website or at

one of our preferred partner sites, such as Code Ocean, Dryad

Native language author names
If the paper is published, the author name(s) will be displayed online

in Latin-alphabet characters as provided to us on the manuscript. If

authors wish for an alternative name also to be displayed (for

instance, the non-Anglicized Chinese-character version of an author

name, or an alternate name by which the author is commonly

known) please include that name in parentheses, immediately after

the Latin-character name in the manuscript. Note that alternatives

names will be presented as supplied on our website and in the article

PDF but may not be presented in other locations where the published

article appears, such as Pubmed.

Native language abstracts
For Features or Perspectives from other non-English speaking

countries, a native-language abstract is encouraged and welcome. It

is considered academic content and is presented as part of the article

in the HTML and PDF, in addition to the traditional English language

abstract. The translated abstract should be compiled by the author

and placed after the English abstract in the initial submission within

the main document; it will be published as part of the article both

Submit your video as a .mp4 file, at a good resolution for

streaming playback.

A caption should be provided in the manuscript file as for a

regular figure, alongside a representative still image for the PDF

(named clearly e.g., Video_1_placeholder.jpg).

Background music in videos will not be accepted, unless you hold

the copyright or have permission to reuse. See reusing

copyrighted material for more information.

All videos must include either clear English-language narration

(preferred) or subtitles (in English) as a guide to the viewer.

Please do not submit animated gif files, which may be published

as single image. Instead, please convert the gif to an .mp4 file.

We cannot use videos hosted on third-party sites such as

YouTube, as the link may expire.

Signed Participant Consent Forms must be included for any

individuals featured in the video[s].

See OUP’s Video and media guide for further guidance on

preparing videos for submission.

Short titles can be added to different sections of the video,

enabling the reader to ‘jump’ from section to section by clicking

on titles. If authors would like to add this feature, they should

follow the instructions given here and should upload resulting

items as a ‘Cuepoint file’ when submitting the manuscript to the

magazine.

Videos should not reveal author names, affiliations, logos, or any

other identifying information.

Publication

An embedded version of the video will appear in the final online

version of the article. In the article PDF, it will be replaced by a

representative still image, cited in the text as ‘Video 1’ etc.

Videos will not be edited for publication.

Video abstracts
Authors of Features and Perspectives are encouraged to submit a

video abstract as a separate, clearly named .mp4 file (e.g.,

video_abstract.mp4) in addition to the text abstract. The video

abstract should clearly summarize the focus and findings of the

article and will be published as part of the paper online. See this page

for guidance on appropriate file format and resolution for videos.

Pre-submission and language editing
Published articles represent the culmination of research efforts,

often lengthy and highly sophisticated ones. To do those efforts

justice, however, the articles must be well written; poorly written

articles not only place an unnecessary burden on readers, they also

cast doubt on the quality of the research itself. We encourage authors

to have other fisheries professionals critique their initial drafts with

respect to presentation as well as substance.

Authors whose native language is not English should make a point of

having English speakers review their manuscripts before

submission.

Free assistance is available from the International Fisheries Section

of AFS, or, our publisher, Oxford University Press, partners with

Enago, a leading provider of author services. Prospective authors are

entitled to a discount of 30% for editing services at Enago, through

the OUP-Enago partner page. Enago is an independent service

provider, who will handle all aspects of this service, including

payment.

Authors are not required to use either service. Language editing is

optional and does not guarantee that the manuscript will be

accepted. Edited manuscripts will undergo the regular review process

of the Magazine.

Cover letter
Initial submission

Although the submission site permits authors to include a cover

letter, such letters are generally not necessary; they should be

https://academic.oup.com/ﬁsheries/pages/general-instructions?login=false

40/45

12/30/25, 12:29 PM

included only when they contain information that cannot easily be

incorporated into the standard submission form.

Revised submission

Authors are required to provide a detailed point-by-point cover letter

explaining how they have responded to the comments in the

decision letter. Such cover letters will also be required if transferring

a manuscript with reviews or resubmitting a manuscript as a new

submission after the revision deadline expired.

Manuscript format
As an aid to reviewers and editors, authors should:

1.  Use double spacing for all components of the paper.

2.  Number all pages sequentially and provide continuous line

numbering beginning with the title page.

3.  Use a 12-point font throughout.

4.  Clearly label all required manuscript elements, e.g., abstract,

lay summary, introduction, etc.

Style, conventions, and abbreviations
The Magazine follows APA style with an author-date citation

system. More information on the magazine’s style and reference

examples are available here.

For other elements, especially those relating to fisheries science, the

magazine will defer to the AFS style guide.

For initial submission, authors need not worry about strictly

following all style guidelines. The vast majority will be applied

during the copyediting process. However, for transparency we’ve

outlined many of our rules and preferences below.

The standard resource for word usage and spelling is Webster’s Third

New International Dictionary, as updated by the latest edition

of Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary. Appendix A of the AFS

style guide shows the proper way to spell many of the terms used in

fisheries writing (some of which are not in the dictionary), including

https://academic.oup.com/ﬁsheries/pages/general-instructions?login=false

41/45

12/30/25, 12:29 PM

General Instructions | Fisheries | Oxford Academic

terms for which our preferred spelling differs from that in the

dictionary.

The standard resource for the common and scientific names of North

American fish species is the current edition of Common and Scientific

Names of Fishes from the United States, Canada, and Mexico (American

Fisheries Society, Bethesda, Maryland). For other aquatic species,

authors should follow the companion publications World Fishes

Important to North Americans and Common and Scientific Names of

Aquatic Invertebrates from the United States and Canada (the

volumes Mollusks, Decapod Crustaceans, and Cnidaria and

Ctenophora are currently available in the latter series).

In most cases, scientific names should be included only at first

mention in the abstract and text; full common names (e.g., “Coho

Salmon” rather than simply “Coho”) should be used elsewhere. The

format for the first mention is “Coho Salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch,”

in which all parts of the common name are capitalized and the

scientific name follows the common name but is not given in

parentheses or offset with a comma.

A note on fish plurals: in formal writing, some species use the zero

plural while others use “s” or “es.” While the accepted plurals of fish

names are given in Appendix C of the AFS style guide, we will follow

the author’s preference (e.g., 12 Alligator Gar or 12 Alligator Gars) to

form the plural of fish names provided the usage is consistent

throughout the manuscript.

In papers about population dynamics, we prefer the notation used by

W. E. Ricker in Computation and Interpretation of Biological Statistics of

Fish Populations (Fisheries Research Board of Canada Bulletin 191,

1975). However, all symbols should be defined anew in every paper.

Our standard sources for chemical and enzyme names are the

current editions of the Merck Index (Merck & Co., Rahway, New Jersey)

and Enzyme Nomenclature (Academic Press, San Diego, California),

respectively. The preferred treatment of allozymes is noted in the

article “Gene Nomenclature for Protein-Coding Loci in Fish” by J. B.

Shaklee et al. (Transactions of the American Fisheries Society 119:2–15,

1990).

It is not possible to provide a detailed presentation of all style

convention within these guidelines. The following conventions,

however, are so general as to apply to virtually every paper:

1.  Only symbols, abbreviations, and acronyms approved for the

International System of Units, appearing in Webster’s

dictionaries, or provided in the AFS symbols and abbreviations

list may be used without definition. All others should be

defined at first use (e.g., index of biotic integrity [IBI]).

Abbreviations should not be introduced unless they are used

at least two more times.

2.  All measurements should be given in metric units. The only

exceptions are a few quantities that are typically expressed

only one way (e.g., g [of medication]/lb [of feed]).

3.  Single-digit numbers should be spelled out unless they are

used with units of measure or in conjunction with larger

values (e.g., 2 mg/L; 8 Walleyes and 16 Saugers). Numbers with

four or more digits should contain commas; those less than

1.00 should be preceded by zeroes.

4.  Ratios involving two values or units of measure should be

indicated by forward slashes (e.g., 0.30 g/day); ratios involving

three such terms should be indicated by negative exponents

(e.g., 0.01 g · g  · day ).

–1

–1

5.  Ages of fish should be expressed by Arabic numerals and not

contain plus signs (e.g., a fish is age 1 [not age 1+] from the

January 1 after it hatches to the following December 31).

6.  Dates should be expressed as month–day–year (e.g., January

11, 2011). Note that the term “Julian day” does not mean day of

the year and should not be used in that context.

7.  Time should be expressed in terms of the 24-hour clock

followed by the word “hours” (e.g., 1435 hours rather than 2:35

p.m.).

Footnotes
Footnotes should be kept to a minimum. Typically, they are used to

report changes of address for authors, identify additional sources of

https://academic.oup.com/ﬁsheries/pages/general-instructions?login=false

43/45

12/30/25, 12:29 PM

data, or explain technical nomenclature (e.g., ages of anadromous

fish and structures of fatty acids). Bring all text footnotes together

after the references.

Mathematical and statistical expressions
General points include:

1.  Symbols representing variables and parameters should be

italicized if they consist of single letters in the Latin alphabet

(e.g., K and F). All other symbols except Greek letters may be

italicized or not, provided that the treatment is consistent

(e.g., CPUE or CPUE); Greek letters should never be italicized.

2.  Natural logarithms may be expressed as log  or ln; logarithms

e

with other bases should identify the base (e.g., log ).

10

3.  Long equations should be “broken” at logical points, normally

after an operator such as a plus or minus sign.

4.  Definitions of variables and parameters may be run into the

text if only a few such terms are involved. If there are a

number of them or they are used in more than one equation, a

list is preferable.

5.  Avoid the expressions “the mean length was 45.2 ± 3.84 mm”

and “the mean (±SD) length was 45.2 ± 3.84 mm” because they

are at best awkward and at worst inaccurate. Use the

expressions “the mean ± SD length was 45.2 ± 3.84 mm” or

“the mean length was 45.2 mm (SD, 3.84)” instead.

LaTeX
Information on LaTeX files and formatting is available. For authors

preparing their manuscripts using LaTeX, Overleaf RASTI LaTeX

class files are available; these simulate the appearance of the

magazine page. Authors are encouraged to use these, although

papers prepared using other class files can also be accepted.
