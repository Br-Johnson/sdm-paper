A C K N OWLED GM EN TS

The  precursor  to  the  Publication  Manual  of  the  American  Psychological  Association  was  published  in  1929  as  a  seven-page
article in Psychological Bulletin describing a “standard of procedure, to which exceptions would doubtless be necessary, but to
which  reference  might  be  made  in  cases  of  doubt”  (Bentley  et  al.,  1929,  p.  57).  Since  then,  the  scope  and  length  of  the
Publication Manual have grown in response to the needs of researchers, students, and educators across the social and behavioral
sciences, health care, natural sciences, humanities, and more; however, the spirit of the original authors’ intentions remains.

To address changes in scholarly writing and publishing since the release of the sixth edition, we consulted many professional
groups  and  experts  (each  recognized  individually  in  the  Editorial  Staff  and  Contributors  list).  We  thank  members  of  the
Publication Manual Revision Task Force for their vision for the manual and for ensuring that our guidance reflects current best
practices.  We  also  thank  the  APA  Working  Group  on  Quantitative  Research  Reporting  Standards  for  updating  the  original
journal  article  reporting  standards  (JARS)  for  quantitative  research  and  the  APA  Working  Group  on  Reporting  Standards  for
Qualitative Research for their groundbreaking work in establishing the first set of qualitative and mixed methods JARS in APA
Style. We are indebted to members of the APA Public Interest Directorate committees and other advocacy groups who revised
the  bias-free  language  guidelines  on  age,  disability,  race  and  ethnicity,  sexual  orientation  and  gender  diversity,  and
socioeconomic status. We are also grateful to the reviewers who provided valuable perspectives while representing psychology,
nursing, education, business, social work, ethics, and writing instruction.

The  important  work  of  the  Publication  Manual  Revision  Task  Force,  JARS  working  groups,  APA  bias-free  language
committees, and other experts builds on efforts from previous groups. Thus, we also acknowledge the significant contributions
of prior task forces, working groups, and APA staff members who revised previous editions of the Publication Manual.

For her contribution to the sections on race and ethnicity, we thank Karen Suyemoto from the University of Massachusetts
Boston. For their insights on sexual orientation, gender, and disability, we thank reviewers from the Human Rights Campaign:
Jay Brown, Katalina Hadfield, Ellen Kahn, and Sula Malina. We also thank lore m. dickey, Mira Krishnan, and Anneliese A.
Singh, members of APA Division 44: Society for the Psychology of Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity, for their expertise
in  revising  the  sections  on  sexual  orientation  and  gender  diversity.  For  his  suggestions  regarding  substance  use  language,  we
thank William W. Stoops from the University of Kentucky College of Medicine. They all shared their wisdom and passion for
their communities to help people write with respect and inclusivity.

This  edition  of  the  Publication Manual  is  more  accessible  thanks  in  large  part  to  the  enthusiastic,  detailed,  and  thoughtful
contributions  from  David  Berman  Communications—in  particular,  David  Berman,  Michael  E.  Cooper,  Hannah  Langford
Berman, and Krisandra Ivings. They helped refine our recommendations for fonts, headings, reference style, color contrast, and
more to benefit all people who will use the manual.

For their guidance on presenting findings in tables and figures, we thank Adelheid A. M. Nicol and Penny M. Pexman. We
also  thank  Gilad  Chen,  Anne  M.  Galletta,  Roger  Giner-Sorolla,  Kevin  Grimm,  Lisa  L.  Harlow,  Wendy  Rogers,  and  Nadine
Michele Weidman for their insights into publishing. We thank Steve W. J. Kozlowski, Open Science and Methodology Chair, for
his expertise on replication and publication ethics. For their valuable expertise on legal references, we thank David DeMatteo
and Kirk Heilbrun from Drexel University.

IN TR OD U C TION

Excellence in writing is critical for success in many academic and professional pursuits. APA Style is a set of guidelines for clear
and precise scholarly communication that helps authors, both new and experienced, achieve excellence in writing. It is used by
millions of people around the world in psychology and also in fields ranging from nursing to social work, communications to
education, business to engineering, and other disciplines for the preparation of manuscripts for publication as well as for writing
student papers, dissertations, and theses. The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association is the authoritative
resource for APA Style, and we are proud to deliver its seventh edition.

Why Use APA Style?

APA Style provides a foundation for effective scholarly communication because it helps authors present their ideas in a clear,
concise, and organized manner. Uniformity and consistency enable readers to (a) focus on the ideas being presented rather than
formatting and (b) scan works quickly for key points, findings, and sources. Style guidelines encourage authors to fully disclose
essential information and allow readers to dispense with minor distractions, such as inconsistencies or omissions in punctuation,
capitalization, reference citations, and presentation of statistics.

When  style  works  best,  ideas  flow  logically,  sources  are  credited  appropriately,  and  papers  are  organized  predictably  and
consistently. People are described using language that affirms their worth and dignity. Authors plan for ethical compliance and
report critical details of their research protocol to allow readers to evaluate findings and other researchers to potentially replicate
the studies. Tables and figures present data in an engaging, consistent manner.

Whether  you  use  APA  Style  for  a  single  class  or  throughout  your  career,  we  encourage  you  to  recognize  the  benefits  of  a
conscientious approach to writing. Although the guidelines span many areas and take time and practice to learn, we hope that
they provide a balance of directiveness and flexibility and will eventually become second nature.

APA Style for Students

The Publication Manual  has  long  been  an  authoritative  source  for  scholarly  writing,  and  this  edition  provides  more  targeted
guidance and support for students. All students, no matter what career they pursue, can benefit from mastering scholarly writing
as a way to develop their critical thinking skills and hone the precision and clarity of their communication.

Most guidelines in the Publication Manual can be applied to both student papers and professional manuscripts. The manual
also  has  elements  specifically  designed  for  students,  including  a  student  title  page;  guidance  on  citing  classroom  or  intranet
sources; and descriptions of common types of student papers such as annotated bibliographies, response papers, and dissertations
and theses. Journal article reporting standards (JARS) are intended primarily for authors seeking publication but may be helpful
for students completing advanced research projects.

Utility and Accessibility

17

We  have  created  the  seventh  edition  of  the  Publication  Manual  with  the  practical  needs  of  users  in  mind.  Within  chapters,
content is organized using numbered sections to help users quickly locate answers to their questions. This ease of navigability
and depth of content mean that the manual can be used as both a reference work and a textbook on scholarly writing.

This edition promotes accessibility for everyone, including users with disabilities. In consultation with accessibility experts,
we ensured that the guidelines support users who read and write works in APA Style through a variety of modalities, including
screen readers and other assistive technologies. For example, we present a streamlined format for in-text citations intended to
reduce the burden of both writing and reading them. We provide guidance on how to use adequate contrast in figures to meet
Web  Content  Accessibility  Guidelines  (Web  Accessibility  Initiative,  2018).  We  also  support  the  use  of  a  variety  of  fonts  and
default settings in common word-processing programs, meaning that users need to make fewer adjustments to their systems to
be ready to write in APA Style. Above all, our aim is to support the many ways in which people communicate. We encourage
authors to be conscientious and respectful toward both the people about whom they are writing and the readers who will benefit
from their work.

What’s New in the Seventh Edition?

Brief  descriptions  of  new  and  updated  content  are  provided  next  on  a  chapter-by-chapter  basis.  For  a  more  comprehensive
overview of content changes, see the APA Style website (https://apastyle.apa.org).

Chapter 1: Scholarly Writing and Publishing Principles
Chapter 1 addresses types of papers and ethical compliance.

New  guidance  addresses  quantitative,  qualitative,  and  mixed  methods  articles  as  well  as  student  papers,  dissertations,  and
theses.

Information on planning for and ensuring ethical compliance reflects best practices.

Guidance on data sharing, including in qualitative research, reflects open practice standards.

Chapter 2: Paper Elements and Format
Chapter 2 is designed to help novice users of APA Style select, format, and organize paper elements.

The title page is updated for professionals, and a new student title page is provided.

For all papers, the byline and affiliation format on the title page aligns with publishing standards.

The author note includes more information, such as ORCID iDs, disclosure of conflicts of interest or lack thereof, and study
registration information.

The running head format has been simplified for professional authors and is not required for students.

Font specifications are more flexible to address the need for accessibility.

An updated heading format for Levels 3, 4, and 5 improves readability and assists authors who use the heading-styles feature
of their word-processing program.

Two new sample papers are provided: a professional paper and a student paper, with labels to show how specific elements
appear when implemented.

Chapter 3: Journal Article Reporting Standards
Chapter  3  orients  users  to  journal  article  reporting  standards  (JARS)  and  includes  tables  outlining  standards  for  reporting
quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods research.

JARS for quantitative research has been significantly expanded and updated (see Appelbaum et al., 2018; Cooper, 2018).

The updated JARS now cover qualitative and mixed methods research (see Levitt, 2019; Levitt et al., 2018).

Chapter 4: Writing Style and Grammar
Chapter 4 provides guidance on writing style and grammar.

18

The singular “they” is endorsed, consistent with inclusive usage.

More detailed guidance helps writers avoid anthropomorphism.

Chapter 5: Bias-Free Language Guidelines
Chapter 5 presents bias-free language guidelines to encourage authors to write about people with inclusivity and respect.

Existing guidance on age, disability, gender, racial and ethnic identity, and sexual orientation has been updated to reflect best
practices.

New guidance is provided on participation in research, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality.

Chapter 6: Mechanics of Style
Chapter 6 covers the mechanics of style, including punctuation, capitalization, abbreviations, numbers, and statistics in text.

Updated guidance answers a common question: Use one space after a period at the end of a sentence, unless an instructor or
publisher requests otherwise.

Formatting  of  linguistic  examples  has  changed;  quotation  marks  are  now  used  around  examples,  rather  than  italics,  to
promote accessibility.

Expanded guidance is provided on the capitalization of proper nouns, job titles, diseases and disorders, and more.

Guidelines  for  the  presentation  of  abbreviations  address  common  questions,  such  as  how  to  include  a  citation  with  an
abbreviation.

Guidelines for the presentation of numbers have been updated to be consistent throughout a work (e.g., there is no longer an
exception for presenting numbers in an abstract).

New guidance is given on how to write gene and protein names.

Updated guidelines allow greater flexibility for lettered, numbered, and bulleted lists.

Chapter 7: Tables and Figures
Chapter 7 presents guidance on creating tables and figures.

More  than  40  new  sample  tables  and  figures  are  presented,  in  dedicated  sections,  covering  a  variety  of  research  types  and
topics.

The presentation of tables and figures in text is more flexible (either after the reference list on separate pages or embedded in
the text).

Formatting of tables and figures is parallel, including consistent styles for numbers, titles, and notes.

The accessible use of color in figures is addressed.

Chapter 8: Works Credited in the Text
Chapter 8 addresses appropriate levels of citation as well as plagiarism, self-plagiarism, and other unethical writing practices.

In-text citations have been simplified; all in-text citations for works with three or more authors are shortened to the name of
the first author plus “et al.” (except where this would create ambiguity).

New guidance is provided on how to cite recorded or unrecorded Traditional Knowledge and Oral Traditions of Indigenous
Peoples.

Examples of paraphrasing demonstrate how to achieve clear attribution without overcitation.

New guidance is provided on how to format quotations from research participants.

Chapter 9: Reference List
Chapter 9 examines the four elements of a reference list entry (author, date, title, and source).

The  number  of  authors  included  in  a  reference  entry  has  changed;  up  to  20  authors  are  now  included  before  names  are
omitted with an ellipsis.

19

The presentation of digital object identifiers (DOIs) and URLs has been standardized. Both are presented as hyperlinks; the
label “DOI:” is no longer used, and the words “Retrieved from” are used only when a retrieval date is also needed.

Updated guidance explains when to include DOIs and URLs for works retrieved from most academic research databases as
well as from proprietary databases such as ERIC or UpToDate.

New formatting guidance is provided for annotated bibliographies.

Chapter 10: Reference Examples
Chapter 10 provides more than 100 examples of APA Style references, each with accompanying parenthetical and narrative in-
text citations.

Templates are provided for every reference category.

References are streamlined; for example, journal article references always include the issue number, and book references now
omit the publisher location.

Audiovisual  materials  receive  expanded  coverage,  with  new  examples  for  YouTube  videos,  PowerPoint  slides  and  lecture
notes, TED Talks, and more.

Social  media,  webpages,  and  websites  are  addressed  in  new  categories.  For  consistency  and  ease  of  formatting,  blogs  and
other online platforms that publish articles are part of the periodicals category.

Chapter 11: Legal References
Chapter 11 presents expanded and updated legal reference examples.

Guidelines from The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation continue to be the foundation for APA Style legal references,
with some modifications.

New, relevant legal reference examples are provided (e.g., the Every Student Succeeds Act).

Chapter 12: Publication Process
Chapter 12 provides guidance on the publication process.

New content helps early career researchers adapt a dissertation or thesis into a journal article or articles, select a journal for
publication, avoid predatory or deceptive publishers, and navigate journal submission.

Improved  guidance  on  the  journal  publication  process  reflects  current  processes  and  policies  authors  need  to  be  aware  of
when preparing a manuscript for submission.

New guidance addresses how authors can share and promote their work following publication.

Notes to Users

20

The  Publication  Manual  refers  to  numerous  products  and  services  that  are  not  affiliated  with  the  American  Psychological
Association but that our readers may encounter or use during the process of research, writing, and publication. The trademarks
referenced  in  the  Publication Manual  are  the  property  of  their  respective  owners.  The  inclusion  of  non-APA  products  is  for
reference only and should not be construed as an endorsement of or affiliation between APA and the owners of these products
and their respective brands.

Finally, some eagle-eyed users have asked why every aspect of APA Style is not applied throughout this manual. The manual
is  a  published  work,  whereas  the  guidelines  for  APA  Style  are  meant  to  be  applied  to  manuscripts  being  submitted  for
publication  or  to  student  papers.  Considerations  for  published  works  such  as  this  book  (e.g.,  typesetting,  line  spacing,  length,
fonts, use of color, margins) differ from those of draft manuscripts or student papers and thus necessitate deviations from APA
Style  formatting.  Also,  in  this  manual—in  which  we  are  writing  about  writing—it  is  often  necessary  to  distinguish  between
explanatory text and examples through the use of font, color, and other design elements. Wherever possible, however, we have
endeavored to demonstrate APA Style while writing about it and to present the information in a way that is accessible for our
many users around the world.

Research is complete only when scholars share their results or findings with the scientific community. Although researchers may
post articles on scholarly collaboration sites or preprint servers or share them informally by email or in person, the most widely
accepted medium for formal scholarly communication continues to be the published article in a peer-reviewed, scientific journal.
Scientific journals contain our primary research literature and thus serve as repositories of the accumulated knowledge of a field.
Students are also important members of the scholarly community. Although most student work is not formally published, by
writing papers students engage in critical thinking, thoughtful self-reflection, and scientific inquiry and thereby prepare to make
unique contributions to the repository of knowledge. Therefore, student writing deserves the same level of care and attention to
detail as that given to professional writing.

In  this  chapter,  we  provide  important  principles  that  professional  and  student  authors  should  consider  before  writing  their
paper or, in many cases, before embarking on a research study. We begin with overviews of the different types of articles and
papers professional and student authors write. This is followed by a discussion of ethical, legal, and professional standards in
publishing that all authors of scholarly work, regardless of the type of paper they are writing or their level of experience, must be
mindful  of  and  abide  by.  For  example,  research  conducted  with  human  participants  or  nonhuman  animal  subjects  must  be
approved  by  an  institutional  review  board  (IRB),  institutional  animal  care  and  use  committee  (IACUC),  or  another  ethical
committee.  Similarly,  an  author  writing  about  human  participants  must  protect  their  confidentiality  while  following  best
practices  for  data  sharing.  Moreover,  any  written  work,  from  a  course  paper  to  a  published  manuscript,  should  represent  an
original contribution and include appropriate citations to the work of others. Thus, scholarly writing and publishing, in all forms,
are inherently embedded in and guided by an ethical context.

Types of Articles and Papers

Many  types  of  articles  are  published  in  scientific  journals,  including  quantitative,  qualitative,  and  mixed  methods  empirical
articles  and  replications.  These  journal  articles  report  primary,  or  original,  research—that  is,  research  that  has  not  been
previously  formally  published.  Theoretical  articles  and  methodological  articles  do  not  present  research  but  describe
advancements in theories or methods. Journal articles that review or synthesize findings from primary research include literature
reviews and quantitative and qualitative meta-analyses. By understanding the characteristics of different types of articles and the
types of information they most efficiently convey, you will be able to select an article type that fits your research and to follow
the appropriate journal article reporting standards (discussed in Chapter 3). Students may write the same kinds of articles that are
published  in  journals,  as  well  as  student  papers  (including  course  assignments,  dissertations,  and  theses)  not  intended  for
publication in a journal (see Section 1.10). Sample papers are included at the end of Chapter 2 and on the APA Style website
(https://apastyle.apa.org).

1.1 Quantitative Articles
In  quantitative  articles,  authors  report  original,  empirical,  quantitative  research.  Quantitative  research  refers  to  a  set  of
approaches  commonly  used  in  the  behavioral  and  social  sciences  and  related  fields  in  which  the  observed  outcomes  are

24

numerically  represented.  The  results  of  these  studies  are  typically  analyzed  using  methods  (statistics,  data  analyses,  and
modeling  techniques)  that  rely  on  the  numerical  properties  of  the  measurement  system.  Quantitative  research  studies  use  a
variety of experimental designs and a range of analytic techniques. Some quantitative articles present novel hypotheses and data
analyses not considered or addressed in previous reports of related data. Within the article, authors should describe elements of
their study in the first person (see Section 4.16). Researchers who used a quantitative approach should follow the quantitative
journal article reporting standards to report their findings (see Sections 3.5–3.12).

Quantitative  articles  typically  include  distinct  sections  that  reflect  the  stages  of  the  research  process  and  appear  in  the

following sequence:

Introduction: a statement of the purpose of the investigation, a review of the background literature, and an explicit statement
of the hypotheses being explored (see Section 3.4)

Method: a  full  description  of  each  step  of  the  investigation,  including  details  about  the  materials  used  and  the  procedures
followed  (which  should  be  sufficient  to  enable  replication),  a  full  statement  of  the  research  design,  statements  on  the
protection of human participants or nonhuman animal subjects and informed consent, and a description (in words and/or a
figure) of the flow of participants through the study (see Section 3.6)

Results: data analysis and a report of the findings (see Section 3.7)

Discussion: a summary of the study, including any interpretation, limitations, and implications of the results (see Section 3.8)

Reports of Multiple Studies. Authors of quantitative articles often report the findings of several conceptually linked studies in
one  manuscript.  These  authors  should  make  the  rationale,  logic,  order,  and  method  of  each  study  clear  to  readers.  Headings
should  be  used  to  label  each  study—for  instance,  “Experiment  1,”  “Experiment  2,”  and  so  forth.  This  format  organizes  the
sections and makes them easier to discuss in the manuscript or in later research articles. Method and Results subsections can
appear  under  each  study  heading.  If  appropriate,  the  authors  can  include  a  short  subsection  titled  “Discussion”  in  which  they
explore the implications of the results of each study, or they can combine the discussion with the description of results under a
heading such as “Results and Discussion.” Authors should always include a comprehensive general discussion of all the studies
at the end of the article, which often has the heading “General Discussion.”

1.2 Qualitative Articles
In qualitative articles, authors report original, empirical, qualitative research. Qualitative research refers to scientific practices
that are used to generate knowledge about human experience and/or action, including social processes. Qualitative approaches
tend to share four sets of characteristics:

Researchers analyze data consisting of natural language (i.e., words), researcher observations (e.g., social interactions), and/or
participants’  expressions  (e.g.,  artistic  presentations)  rather  than  collecting  numerical  data  and  conducting  mathematical
analyses.  Reports  tend  to  show  the  development  of  qualitative  findings  using  natural  language  (although  numbers  may  be
used adjunctively in describing or exploring these findings).

Researchers often use an iterative process of analysis in which they reexamine developing findings in light of continued data
analysis  and  refine  the  initial  findings.  In  this  way,  the  process  of  analysis  is  self-correcting  and  can  produce  original
knowledge.

Researchers recursively combine inquiry with methods that require researchers’ reflexivity about how their own perspectives
might support or impair the research process and thus how their methods should best be enacted.

Researchers tend to study experiences and actions whose meaning may shift and evolve; therefore, they tend to view their
findings  as  being  situated  within  place  and  time  rather  than  seeking  to  develop  laws  that  are  expected  to  remain  stable
regardless of context.

Researchers  who  used  a  qualitative  approach  should  follow  the  qualitative  journal  article  reporting  standards  to  report  their
findings (see Sections 3.13–3.17).

Case  Studies  and  Other  Types  of  Qualitative  Articles.  A  variety  of  methods  are  reported  in  qualitative  articles,  and  the
structure  of  qualitative  articles  varies  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  study.  For  example,  in  case  studies  researchers  report
analyses  or  observations  obtained  while  working  closely  with  an  individual,  group,  community,  or  organization.  Case  studies
illustrate a problem in depth; indicate a means for solving a problem; and/or shed light on needed research, clinical applications,

25

or theoretical matters. Qualitative articles also describe studies with multiple participants, groups, communities, or organizations
that  identify  commonalities  and/or  differences  across  these  entities.  Such  research  can  have  a  systemic  focus,  examining  the
ways in which social processes, actions, or discourses are structured.

Regardless  of  the  qualitative  research  approaches  they  use,  when  writing  reports,  authors  should  carefully  consider  the
balance between providing important illustrative material and using confidential participant data responsibly (see Sections 1.18–
1.19 for more on confidentiality; see also Section 1.15). Qualitative reports may be organized thematically or chronologically
and  are  typically  presented  in  a  reflexive,  first-person  style,  detailing  the  ways  in  which  the  researchers  arrived  at  questions,
methods, findings, and considerations for the field.

1.3 Mixed Methods Articles
In mixed methods articles, authors report research combining qualitative and quantitative empirical approaches. Mixed methods
research should not be confused with mixed models research, which is a quantitative procedure, or with multimethods research,
which entails using multiple methods from the same approach. Mixed methods research involves the following:

describing the philosophical assumptions or theoretical models used to inform the study design (Creswell, 2015);

describing the distinct methodologies, research designs, and procedures in relation to the study goals;

collecting and analyzing both qualitative and quantitative data in response to research aims, questions, or hypotheses; and

integrating the findings from the two methodologies intentionally to generate new insights.

The  basic  assumption  of  a  mixed  methods  approach  is  that  the  combined  qualitative  findings  and  quantitative  results  lead  to
additional insights not gleaned from the qualitative or quantitative findings alone (Creswell, 2015; Greene, 2007; Tashakkori &
Teddlie, 2010). Because there are many ways to design a mixed methods study, the structure of mixed methods articles varies
depending on the specific nature of the study and the balance between the two methodologies. Researchers who used a mixed
methods  approach  should  follow  the  mixed  methods  journal  article  reporting  standards  to  report  their  findings  (see  Section
3.18).

1.4 Replication Articles
In replication articles, authors report the results of work intended to verify or reproduce findings from previous investigations.
The  aim  of  a  replication study  is  to  examine  whether  the  conclusions  from  an  earlier  study  remain  the  same  or  similar  over
variations in the conduct of the original study. There are internal and external forms of replication; only external replications are
addressed in APA journal article reporting standards (see Section 3.10). An external replication occurs when researchers obtain a
new  sample  and  duplicate,  insofar  as  is  possible  or  desirable,  the  features  of  the  original  study  being  replicated.  New  design,
measures, and/or data-analysis methods can also be used to test whether a finding has generality beyond the particular situation
studied in the original work, but any such variations must be clearly specified in the report.

Researchers conducting an external replication should report sufficient information to allow readers to determine whether the
study  was  a  direct  (exact,  literal)  replication,  approximate  replication,  or  conceptual  (construct)  replication.  In  a  direct
replication,  researchers  repeat  a  study  collecting  data  from  a  new  sample  in  a  way  that  duplicates  as  far  as  possible  the
conditions of the earlier study. A  direct  replication  is  called  an  exact replication or  a  literal replication  when  researchers  use
procedures  that  are  identical  to  the  original  experiment  or  duplicated  as  closely  as  possible  (e.g.,  with  variations  only  in  the
location of the study and the investigators conducting the study). These forms of replication are useful for establishing that the
findings  of  the  original  study  are  reliable.  In  an  approximate  replication  (or  a  modified  replication),  researchers  incorporate
alternative  procedures  and  additional  conditions  into  the  features  of  the  original  study;  such  replications  usually  contain  the
original study design along with some additional study features. The purpose of an approximate or modified replication may be
not  only  to  replicate  a  study  but  also  to  determine  whether  some  factors  not  included  in  the  original  formulation  have  an
influence  on  the  outcome.  In  a  conceptual  replication,  researchers  introduce  different  techniques  and  manipulations  to  gain
theoretical information; it is possible that no features of the initial study are retained. Researchers may use other labels for or
descriptions  of  replications  (for  further  exploration  of  this  issue,  see  National  Academies  of  Sciences,  Engineering,  and
Medicine,  2019);  the  descriptions  provided  in  this  section  were  adapted  from  the  APA  Dictionary  of  Psychology
(https://dictionary.apa.org).

1.5 Quantitative and Qualitative Meta-Analyses

26

Meta-analysis refers to a collection of techniques in which researchers use the findings from a group of related studies to draw a
general  conclusion  (synthesis)  based  on  the  extant  research  on  a  topic.  Individual  participant  or  subject  data  are  not  used  in
meta-analyses because the data analyzed are at the study level.

Just as the reporting standards for quantitative and qualitative studies vary by study design, those for meta-analyses vary by
the particular questions asked in the study and the approaches used to answer those questions. Because the study is the input unit
for a meta-analysis, the studies included are provided in the reference list and marked with an indicator that shows they were
part of the meta-analysis. This indicator distinguishes studies included in a meta-analysis from other references. For example, in
APA Style articles, references used in a meta-analysis are preceded by an asterisk (see Section 9.52).

Quantitative Meta-Analysis. Within quantitative approaches, meta-analyses generally stipulate a technique in which effect-size
estimates  from  individual  studies  are  the  inputs  to  the  analyses.  Meta-analysis  is  also  used  to  determine  factors  that  may  be
related  to  the  magnitude  of  the  outcome  in  quantitative  studies—for  example,  design  factors  (e.g.,  randomized  vs.
nonrandomized), demographic factors (e.g., percentage of the study sample below the poverty line), and so forth. Meta-analytic
reports usually follow the same basic structure as quantitative studies (see Section 1.1) and contain an introduction and Method,
Results,  and  Discussion  sections.  Researchers  who  use  a  quantitative  meta-analytic  approach  should  follow  the  reporting
standards for quantitative meta-analysis (see Section 3.12).

Qualitative Meta-Analysis. Within qualitative research, there are a variety of approaches to meta-analysis, including qualitative
metasynthesis,  metaethnography,  metamethod,  and  critical  interpretive  synthesis.  These  approaches  often  use  strategies  from
primary  qualitative  analyses  to  synthesize  findings  across  studies.  Qualitative  meta-analyses  can  be  used  to  highlight
methodological trends, identify common findings and gaps, develop new understandings, and propose future directions for an
area of research. Qualitative meta-analytic reports have a structure similar to that of qualitative primary reports, with the addition
of a description of the perspectives and situatedness of the authors of the primary works included in the analysis. Qualitative
meta-analyses  do  not  entail  a  singular  procedure  but  rather  an  aggregating  function  common  to  meta-analytic  approaches.
Qualitative meta-analyses are not to be confused with quantitative reviews, in which authors generate a narrative description of a
quantitative  literature  base.  We  recommend  referring  to  those  studies  as  literature  reviews  or  narrative  literature  reviews  to
avoid  confusion  with  qualitative  meta-analyses  (see  Section 1.6).  Researchers  who  used  a  qualitative  meta-analytic  approach
should follow the reporting standards for qualitative meta-analysis (see Section 3.17).

1.6 Literature Review Articles
Literature review articles (or narrative literature review articles) provide narrative summaries and evaluations of the findings or
theories  within  a  literature  base.  The  literature  base  may  include  qualitative,  quantitative,  and/or  mixed  methods  research.
Literature reviews capture trends in the literature; they do not engage in a systematic quantitative or qualitative meta-analysis of
the findings from the initial studies.

In literature review articles, authors should

define and clarify the problem;

summarize previous investigations to inform readers of the state of the research;

identify relations, contradictions, gaps, and inconsistencies in the literature; and

suggest next steps in solving the problem.

The components of literature review articles can be arranged in various ways—for example, by grouping research on the basis of
similarity  in  the  concepts  or  theories  of  interest,  methodological  similarities  among  the  studies  reviewed,  or  the  historical
development of the field.

1.7 Theoretical Articles
Theoretical articles draw from existing research literature to advance theory. Theoretical articles present empirical information
only when it advances the theoretical issue being explicated. Authors of theoretical articles trace the development of a theory to
expand  and  refine  its  constructs,  present  a  new  theory,  or  analyze  an  existing  theory.  Typically,  they  point  out  flaws  or
demonstrate the advantage(s) of one theory over another. Authors also may examine a theory’s internal consistency and external
validity. The order of sections in a theoretical article can vary.

27

1.8 Methodological Articles
Methodological articles  present  new  approaches  to  research  or  practice,  modifications  of  existing  methods,  or  discussions  of
quantitative and/or qualitative data analysis. These articles use empirical data (quantitative, qualitative, or both) only as a means
to illustrate an approach to research. Some use simulated data to demonstrate how methods work under varying conditions (e.g.,
different sample sizes, number of variables, level of nonnormality, size of coefficients).

Methodological  articles  provide  sufficient  detail  for  researchers  to  assess  the  applicability  of  the  methodology  and  its
feasibility  for  the  type  of  research  problem  it  is  designed  to  study.  Further,  these  articles  allow  readers  to  compare  proposed
methods  with  those  in  current  use.  In  methodological  articles,  highly  technical  materials  (e.g.,  derivations,  proofs,  data
generation, computer code, extensive details of simulations) should be presented in appendices or as supplemental materials to
improve  overall  article  readability.  When  having  detailed  information  (e.g.,  parameters  used  in  a  simulation)  is  necessary  for
readers to understand the major points being made, those details should be presented in the text of the article.

1.9 Other Types of Articles
Additional  types  of  published  articles  include  brief  reports,  comments  on  and  replies  to  previously  published  articles,  book
reviews, obituaries, and letters to the editor. Authors should consult the editors or author guidelines of individual journals for
specific information regarding these kinds of articles.

1.10 Student Papers, Dissertations, and Theses
Although the Publication Manual originated as a guide for authors seeking publication in scholarly journals, it has been widely
adopted  by  academic  instructors,  departments,  and  institutions  that  require  students  to  use  APA  Style  when  writing  scholarly
papers.  Students  may  write  the  same  types  of  papers  that  are  professionally  published  (e.g.,  literature  review  articles)  or
assignments that fall outside that scope (e.g., dissertations, theses, essays, response or reaction papers, annotated bibliographies).
Likewise,  this  manual  has  historically  addressed  researchers  working  in  the  field  of  psychology;  however,  students  and
researchers  use  APA  Style  in  other  fields  and  disciplines,  including  social  work,  nursing,  communications,  education,  and
business. Some journals in these fields require APA Style, and others do not. Other field-specific requirements may also apply
(e.g., nurses may have to adhere to a nurse’s code of ethics rather than a psychologist’s code of ethics).

Student assignments commonly written at the undergraduate level include annotated bibliographies, many types of essays,
and response or reaction papers. The descriptions that follow are generally representative of these types of papers; check with
your assigning instructor or institution for specific guidelines.

Annotated bibliographies  consist  of  reference  list  entries  followed  by  short  descriptions  of  the  work  called  annotations.
Instructors generally set most requirements for these papers, but many APA Style guidelines still apply (see Section 9.51).

Cause-and-effect essays report how specific events lead to particular results or advocate for a specific position. A clear and
strong thesis provides a solid foundation for this type of essay. The paragraphs are generally structured by describing each
cause and its collateral effect, with logical transitions between them.

Comparative essays compare and contrast two (or more) items with the goal of linking disparate items under a central thesis.
The paper structure can be organized to focus on Topic 1 and then Topic 2, or the topics may be interwoven.

Expository essays follow a multiparagraph structure (e.g., five paragraphs) and explain or provide information on a specific
topic.  The  paper  structure  includes  an  introduction,  body,  and  a  conclusion.  Evidence  should  be  provided  to  reinforce  the
written claims detailed in the paper.

Narrative  essays  convey  a  story  from  a  clear  point  of  view  and  include  a  beginning,  middle,  and  end.  Narrative  essays
should have a clearly defined purpose and focus and include concise, evocative language.

Persuasive essays are intended to convince readers to adopt a certain viewpoint or take a particular action. They present clear
arguments, include logical transitions, and have a similar paper structure to the expository essay.

Précis are concise summaries in students’ own words of essential points, statements, or facts from a single work; the length
of  a  précis  is  typically  about  a  quarter  of  the  length  of  the  original  work.  The  précis  structure  includes  a  brief  thesis  and
sections that mirror the sections of the original work, such as Method, Results, and Discussion.

Response or reaction papers summarize one or more works and describe students’ personal reactions or responses to them,
including how the work or works impacted them, are relevant to their life, and so forth. This type of paper is typically short
(e.g., three pages or so). The first person is used in describing personal reactions (see Section 4.16).

28

Dissertations or theses are  typically  required  of  graduate  students,  but  undergraduate  students  completing  advanced  research
projects may write similar types of papers. Academic institutions or departments have detailed guidelines for how to format and
write dissertations and theses, and the requirements and acceptable format vary by discipline. Some dissertations and theses are
hundreds of pages long and contain thorough literature reviews and exhaustive reference lists, whereas others follow a multiple-
article  format  consisting  of  several  shorter,  related  papers  that  are  intended  for  individual  publication.  See  Section  12.1  for
guidance on adapting a dissertation or thesis into a journal article.

As mentioned in the introduction to this manual, most of the guidelines in the Publication Manual can be applied to student
papers. However, because the scope of what constitutes a student paper is broad and flexible, and because students submit papers
to their academic institutions rather than to an APA journal, we do not designate formal requirements for the nature or contents
of  an  APA  Style  student  paper.  Thus,  questions  about  paper  length,  required  sections,  and  so  forth  are  best  answered  by  the
instructor  or  institution  setting  the  assignment.  Students  should  follow  the  guidelines  and  requirements  developed  by  their
instructors, departments, and/or academic institutions when writing papers, including dissertations and theses; these guidelines
and  requirements  may  entail  adaptations  of  or  additions  to  the  APA  Style  guidelines  described  in  this  manual.  We  encourage
writers, instructors, departments, and academic institutions using APA Style outside of the journal publication context to adapt
APA Style to fit their needs.

Ethical, Legal, and Professional Standards in Publishing

In addition to abiding by standards specific to writing and publishing, authors of scholarly research should also follow ethical
standards  (e.g.,  Section  8,  Research  and  Publication,  of  the  APA  Ethical  Principles  of  Psychologists  and  Code  of  Conduct,
hereinafter referred to as the APA Ethics Code; APA, 2017a; see also https://www.apa.org/ethics/code) and broader professional
standards when conducting a research study. Moreover, individuals engaged in conducting, analyzing, or reporting any type of
research should have acquired the requisite skills and experience to do so competently (e.g., Section 2, Competence, of the APA
Ethics Code; see also the Multicultural  Guidelines:  An  Ecological  Approach  to  Context,  Identity,  and  Intersectionality; APA,
2017b).

Ethical and legal principles underlie all scholarly research and writing. These long-standing principles are designed to achieve

the following goals:

ensuring the accuracy of scientific findings,
protecting the rights and welfare of research participants and subjects, and
protecting intellectual property rights.

Writers in the social and behavioral sciences work to uphold these goals and to follow the principles that have been established
by their professional disciplines. The guidance in this section is drawn from the APA Ethics Code (APA, 2017a), which applies
to  all  APA  members  regardless  of  where  they  publish  and  contains  standards  that  address  the  reporting  and  publishing  of
scientific  data.  The  APA  Ethics  Code  is  not  a  static  document—it  is  revised  over  time  to  reflect  shifts  or  changes  in  the
understanding and conception of the principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence, fidelity and responsibility, integrity, justice,
and respect by the scientific community relative to advances in science and technology and evolving cultural norms. Revised or
new versions of the APA Ethics Code appear on the APA website after adoption by the APA Council of Representatives.

Ensuring the Accuracy of Scientific Findings

1.11 Planning for Ethical Compliance

Regardless  of  the  type  of  article,  attention  to  ethical  concerns  should  begin  long  before  any  manuscript  is  submitted  for
publication.  Among  the  issues  to  carefully  consider  while  research  is  in  the  planning  stages  are  those  related  to  institutional
approval,  informed  consent,  deception  in  research,  participant  protections,  and  data  sharing.  Most  journals,  including  APA
journals, require authors submitting a manuscript for publication to also submit forms affirming their compliance with ethical
standards for research and publication and disclosing their conflicts of interest, if any (see Section 12.13 for more information
and a link to the APA ethical compliance form). We encourage all authors, whether or not they will submit their manuscript to an
APA  journal,  to  consult  these  ethics  resources  before  beginning  their  research  project  and  at  regular  intervals  throughout  the
research  process.  To  ensure  that  they  meet  ethical  standards,  before  starting  a  research  project,  authors  should  contact  the
appropriate  IRB  or  ethical  review  group  for  their  institution  or  country  for  information  on  the  kinds  of  research  that  require

29

ethics approval, procedures for obtaining ethics approval, ethical and research requirements, and so forth. Authors not affiliated
with  a  university,  hospital,  or  other  institution  with  an  IRB  are  still  expected  to  follow  ethical  standards  in  conducting  their
research  and  should  consult  an  external  IRB  if  necessary.  For  more  information  on  IRBs,  see  the  APA  website
(https://on.apa.org/2FuiPJ1).

Authors are encouraged to report in the text of the manuscript the institutional approvals the study received, as described in
the APA journal article reporting standards in Chapter 3 (see Sections 3.6 and 3.14 and Tables 3.1–3.3). Authors should also be
prepared to answer potential questions related to these issues from editors or reviewers during the review process (see Section
12.13). As a final step prior to manuscript submission, authors should also consult the ethical compliance checklist in Section
1.25.

1.12 Ethical and Accurate Reporting of Research Results
The essence of ethics in all scientific reporting is that authors report the methods and results of their studies fully and accurately.
Therefore,  the  ethical  and  professional  issues  discussed  in  this  section  apply  equally  to  quantitative,  qualitative,  and  mixed
methods research (see Chapter 3 for additional reporting standards).

Authors must not fabricate or falsify data (APA Ethics Code Standard 8.10a, Reporting Research Results). Modifying results,
including visual images, to support a theory or hypothesis and omitting troublesome observations from a report to present a more
convincing story are also prohibited (APA Ethics Code Standard 5.01b, Avoidance of False or Deceptive Statements). Similarly,
representing data-generated hypotheses (post hoc) as if they were preplanned is a violation of basic ethical principles.

The practice of “omitting troublesome observations” includes

selectively failing to report studies (e.g., in the introduction or Discussion section) that, although methodologically sound and
relevant to the hypothesis, theory, or research question at hand, had results that do not support the preferred narrative (i.e.,
that contrast with results obtained in the current study);

selectively omitting reports of relevant manipulations, procedures, measures, or findings within a study, for similar reasons;
and

selectively  excluding  participants  or  other  individual  data  observations,  without  a  valid  methodological  reason,  in  order  to
achieve desired results.

To clarify expectations for reporting and help safeguard scientific integrity, APA (like other scientific organizations) has issued a
series of reporting standards (Appelbaum et al., 2018; Cooper, 2018; Levitt, 2019; Levitt et al., 2018). These standards, which
are  discussed  in  Chapter  3,  address  many  aspects  of  the  ethical  reporting  of  experiments.  They  include  expectations  for
describing  all  measured  variables,  for  tracking  participant  flow  through  a  study  (with  an  accompanying  prototype  figure;  see
Figure 7.5 in Section 7.36) so that no participant is selectively excluded without mention, and for reporting special classes of
studies such as clinical trials.

Reporting  standards,  like  the  APA  Ethics  Code,  are  not  static;  changes  are  continually  made  to  improve  how  researchers
report results. One of the more recent and important changes for quantitative research reporting is that hypotheses should now be
stated in three groupings: preplanned–primary, preplanned–secondary,  and  exploratory  (post  hoc).  Exploratory  hypotheses  are
allowable, and there should be no pressure to disguise them as if they were preplanned. Similarly, qualitative researchers should
transparently describe their expectations at the outset of the research as part of their research reporting.

1.13 Errors, Corrections, and Retractions After Publication
Careful  preparation  of  manuscripts  for  publication  is  essential,  but  errors  can  still  appear  in  the  final  published  article.  When
errors are substantive enough to affect readers’ understanding of the research or their interpretation of the results, authors are
responsible for making such errors public.

Corrections. When a correction is needed, the first step is to inform the editor and the publisher of the journal so that a formal
correction notice (erratum) can be published. The goal of such a notice is to openly and transparently correct the knowledge base
for current and future users of the information in the published article. A correction notice is usually appended to the original
article’s record in research databases so that readers will retrieve it when they access either the article or a database’s record for
the  article;  at  times,  the  article  itself  may  also  be  corrected.  See  also  APA  Ethics  Code  Standard  8.10b,  Reporting  Research
Results, as well as Section 12.22 of this manual for further information on when and how to write a correction notice.

30

Retractions.  Occasionally,  the  problems  with  an  article  are  so  great  (e.g.,  plagiarism,  fabrication  or  falsification  of  data,
belatedly  discovered  calculation  or  measurement  errors  that  change  the  interpretation  of  the  findings)  that  the  entire  article  is
retracted  by  the  author  or  authors,  their  institution,  or  the  publisher.  Whatever  the  reason  for  the  retraction,  the  intent  is  to
remove the information from the scientific literature and thus avoid wasting the time and resources of other scientists who might
rely  on  or  attempt  to  replicate  the  compromised  results.  The  retracted  article  may  still  be  available  in  databases;  however,  a
retraction notice will accompany it to notify readers of its status. Authors should avoid citing retracted articles unless the citation
is essential; if authors do cite a retracted article, its reference list entry should reflect that the article has been retracted (see the
APA Style website at https://apastyle.apa.org for an example).

1.14 Data Retention and Sharing
Data  Retention.  Authors  are  expected  to  retain  the  data  associated  with  a  published  article  in  accordance  with  institutional
requirements;  funder  requirements;  participant  agreements;  and,  when  publishing  in  an  APA  journal,  the  APA  Ethics  Code
(Standard 8.14, Sharing Research Data for Verification). When planning a research study and before beginning data collection,
authors are encouraged to consider how the data will be retained (and shared) and to outline clear data-handling procedures in
the study protocol submitted to an IRB or other ethics committee. During the informed consent process, authors should describe
to  study  participants  the  data  they  intend  to  collect,  save,  and/or  share  with  other  researchers  and  obtain  their  approval.  In
qualitative studies, data sharing may not be appropriate because of confidentiality, consent, and other limitations (see Section
1.15).

Data Sharing. The APA Ethics Code prohibits authors from withholding data from qualified requesters for verification through
reanalysis in most circumstances (see Standard 8.14, Sharing Research Data for Verification), as long as the confidentiality of
the participants is protected. The APA Ethics Code permits psychologists to require that a requester be responsible for any costs
associated  with  the  provision  of  the  data.  Increasingly,  funders  are  also  requiring  that  data  be  shared  in  an  open-  or  secured-
access repository or that a data-management plan otherwise be spelled out. Authors publishing in an APA journal are invited to
share their data on APA’s portal on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/view/apa/).

Notably, incentives are offered to researchers who wish to share their data, such as Open Science Badges offered through the
Center for Open Science. Open Science Badges are awarded for the open sharing of materials used by researchers in the process
of data collection and analysis (e.g., instructions, stimuli, blank questionnaires, treatment manuals, software, interview protocols,
details  of  procedures,  code  for  mathematical  models);  source  data,  meaning  the  original  written,  electronic,  or  audiovisual
records  of  the  study  participants’  responses  (e.g.,  paper  questionnaires,  transcripts,  output  files,  observational  notes,  video
recordings); and analysis data, meaning the processed version of the source data used to produce the analyses reported in the
paper.

Sharing During Review. Subject to the conditions and exceptions discussed next, authors are expected to share data, analyses,
and/or  materials  during  the  review  and  publication  process  if  questions  arise  with  respect  to  the  accuracy  of  the  report.  On
request, the authors should share the raw data with the journal’s editor and (if approved by the editor) with reviewers to verify
the reported analyses and data and to assess their rigor. If questions arise about the integrity or processing of the source data,
authors should also share access to them with the editor on request. Costs of sharing data requested during the review process
should  be  borne  by  the  authors.  Similarly,  students  should  expect  to  provide  raw  data  to  faculty  reviewing  their  dissertation,
thesis, or research project. A journal editor has the right to deny publication if the authors refuse to share requested materials or
data during the review process. In the case of student work, refusal to share requested materials or data may result in a failing
grade or defense. See Section 1.15 for additional considerations when sharing access to data from qualitative studies.

Sharing  After  Publication.  Authors  must  make  their  data  available  after  publication,  subject  to  conditions  and  exceptions,
within the period of retention specified by their institution, journal, funder, or other supporting organization. This permits other
competent professionals to confirm the reported analyses using the data on which the authors’ conclusions are based or to test
alternative  analyses  that  address  the  article’s  hypotheses  (see  APA  Ethics  Code  Standard  8.14a,  Sharing  Research  Data  for
Verification, and Standard 6.01, Documentation of Professional and Scientific Work and Maintenance of Records). Competent
professionals are those who are currently accountable to a research institution or an educational employer and who demonstrate
sufficient training and credentials to understand the research study’s background, methods, and analyses. The journal editor may
be asked to determine who qualifies as a competent professional given the topic of the research. See Section 1.15 for additional
considerations when sharing qualitative research data.

31

Typically, any additional costs of complying with a request for data beyond the general standards of internal data maintenance
(e.g.,  anonymization,  transfer  of  data,  translation)  should  be  borne  by  the  requester,  and  these  costs  should  be  assessed  at  a
reasonable local rate for the necessary services and materials. If it emerges that authors are unwilling or unable to share data for
verification  within  the  retention  period,  the  journal’s  current  editor  may  retract  the  article  or  issue  an  Expression  of  Concern
about its findings according to the policy of the publisher.

Data  and  materials  may  sometimes  be  requested  after  publication  for  purposes  beyond  the  ones  outlined  previously.
Regardless of why the data and materials are requested, to avoid misunderstanding, it is important that the researcher requesting
data and the researcher providing it come to a written agreement about the conditions under which the data are to be shared (see
APA Ethics Code Standard 8.14b, Sharing Research Data for Verification). Generally, such an agreement specifies the limits on
how the shared data may be used (e.g., for verification of already published results, for inclusion in meta-analytic studies, for
secondary  analysis),  who  may  have  access  to  the  data  (e.g.,  only  the  requester,  the  requester  and  direct  supervisees,  anyone
interested  with  no  limits  on  further  sharing),  and  how  the  requester  will  store  and  dispose  of  the  data.  Furthermore,  the
agreement should specify any limits on the dissemination of the results of analyses performed on the data (e.g., whether they can
be published in conference presentations, internal reports, journal articles, or book chapters) and any expectations for authorship
of publications based on shared data. Data-sharing arrangements must be entered into with proper consideration of the rights of
the  copyright  owner  (see  Section  12.20),  participants’  consent,  requirements  of  funding  agencies,  requirements  of  IRBs  and
other ethics committees that provided permission to conduct the study, and rules promulgated by the employer of the holder of
the data.

Authors may choose or be required to share data and/or materials openly by posting them online. Journal editors may set a
policy  to  encourage  open  sharing,  to  require  it,  and/or  to  require  authors  to  give  a  reason  why  data  and  materials  cannot  be
shared (e.g., risk to participant privacy). A permanent link to any data or materials to be shared openly should be included in the
article, such as in an Open Practices section in the author note (see Section 2.7); the reference for the data set should also be
included in the reference list of the article (see Section 10.9 for how to cite). Federally funded or grant-funded research is often
subject to requirements for data sharing; see, for example, the data-sharing policies of the National Institutes of Health (n.d.).

Conditions and Exceptions to Data Sharing. Before sharing or posting data and materials for any purpose, researchers must
remove  any  personally  identifiable  information  or  code  that  would  make  it  possible  to  reestablish  a  link  to  an  individual
participant’s identity. Sometimes, a unique combination of demographic or other public information can be used to establish a
participant’s  identity,  and  this  possibility  must  be  kept  in  mind  and  avoided  as  well.  Researchers  should  consult  the  relevant
policies  of  their  institution  or  country  (e.g.,  the  European  Union  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  [GDPR],  the  Health
Insurance  Portability  and  Accountability  Act  [HIPAA])  for  regulations  and  guidance  on  conditions  for  sharing  data  and
deidentifying protected health information.

In addition to protecting the confidentiality of research participants, some proprietary arrangements may prohibit the sharing
of data and materials (e.g., data provided in confidence by a business entity, a coding scheme developed commercially by the
authors). Editors are responsible for setting policy for their journal about the acceptability for publication of research resting on
proprietary arrangements, given that its accuracy and veracity cannot be checked in the usual way. This policy may depend on
the  availability  of  alternative  ways  to  satisfy  concerns  about  scientific  integrity.  For  example,  research  using  a  proprietary
personality  scale  may  be  acceptable  if  enough  qualified  researchers  subscribe  to  it  that  someone  can  be  found  to  help  with
independent verification.

1.15 Additional Data-Sharing Considerations for Qualitative Research
The sharing of qualitative data with editors, peers, and other researchers has distinct considerations in addition to those described
in Section 1.14. The APA Committee on Human Research and numerous qualitative researchers have expressed concerns about
sharing qualitative research data (Data Sharing Working Group, 2015; DuBois et al., 2018; Guishard, 2018). Although consensus
on how to navigate this issue has not yet been established, this section highlights several points that contraindicate or suggest
alternates to data sharing.

Presentation  of  Raw  Data  in  Research  Reports.  Data  are  typically  reproduced  in  qualitative  research  reports.  Segments  of
data (e.g., quotations from interviews) are presented to exemplify the process of analysis and to demonstrate the grounding of
the findings in the data. Because these raw data are available for examination in the text of the article, they provide a basis by
which readers, as well as editors and reviewers during the manuscript review process, can evaluate (and perhaps question) the
appropriateness of the conclusions reached.

32

Confidentiality  Limitations.  The  obligation  to  protect  participants’  confidentiality  can  present  special  ethical  issues  for
qualitative data sharing. For instance, raw data from a qualitative study involving multiple detailed stories about participants’
lives may contain details that are necessary to make the data meaningful but that can be revealing in compromising ways when
triangulated. Qualitative research may also involve intensive case studies of people who were selected because of their unique
attributes. Although the researchers may try to mask participants’ identities within a manuscript, it may not be possible to retain
all that is meaningful to evaluate an analysis and at the same time protect participants’ confidentiality if the complete data set is
shared.  The  high  burden  on  the  researchers  to  remove  all  information  that  can  lead  to  the  identification  of  a  participant  is
unjustifiable if it produces a set of data that is stripped of meaning. As a result, the researchers may instead need to withhold
data  to  ensure  participant  confidentiality  (see  McCurdy  &  Ross,  2018,  on  the  sometimes  prohibitive  complications  of  this
process).

Consent Limitations. There is also the consideration that participants may give consent to participate in a study to a specific
group of researchers and may not extend that consent to other researchers. This may be of particular concern with vulnerable
populations.  For  instance,  lesbian  participants  may  consent  to  have  their  data  analyzed  by  researchers  who  are  in  their
community and who seek to support their rights, but that consent may not apply to other researchers with different motivations.
Likewise,  some  researchers  spend  years  developing  the  trust  to  collect  and  analyze  data  from  a  community,  and  community
members may not extend that trust to other groups of researchers. Indeed, communities may be owners or co-owners of the data
themselves and may refuse to share the data (DuBois et al., 2018; Tuck & Yang, 2014). As a result, the relationship between the
researchers and the participants is an important ethical consideration and one that may contraindicate data sharing.

Researchers’ Perspective Limitations. Many qualitative researchers view their own history and epistemological perspectives
as  legitimate  influences  on  the  process  of  inquiry.  Thus,  when  sharing  data  from  qualitative  research,  the  researchers’
perspectives and experiences must be taken into account. Research can be compromised if researchers are unreflective or not
purposeful  or  explicit  about  this  influence.  However,  when  researchers  are  aware,  they  can  deliberately  elaborate  on  the
investigative attitudes (e.g., phenomenological bracketing), personal experiences (e.g., ethnographic study), research teams (e.g.,
including researchers from the communities under analysis), or analytic lenses (e.g., critical theories) that enrich their research
and  thereby  deepen  the  acuity  they  bring  to  the  analytic  task  (Guishard  et  al.,  2018).  These  qualitative  researchers  would  not
necessarily  expect  editors  or  external  researchers  to  interpret  their  research  in  the  same  way  when  evaluating  their  analysis
because they may not share their perspectives.

In qualitative inquiry, the researchers are the analytic tool, so those who have developed an intimate understanding of a data
set or who have developed a perspective to enhance their sensitivity to the data typically are better attuned to nuances, implicit
meanings,  and  systemic  connections.  This  means  that  an  editor  or  external  researcher  should  not  expect  replication  of  the
findings and should articulate an appropriate purpose and rationale for review of the shared data prior to the data being shared.
Also, the approach to investigation selected may signify epistemological commitments of researchers and their participants, and
these  values  need  to  be  considered  and  honored  in  data-sharing  efforts.  In  any  case,  a  review  of  the  data  would  need  to  be
conducted with a keen awareness of the distinct epistemological positions and analytic processes within qualitative research.

1.16 Duplicate and Piecemeal Publication of Data
Reports  in  the  literature  must  accurately  reflect  the  independence  of  separate  research  efforts.  Both  duplicate  and  piecemeal
publication of data misrepresent the amount of original research in the repository of scientific knowledge. Duplicate publication
is  the  publication  of  the  same  data  or  ideas  in  two  separate  works.  Piecemeal  publication  is  the  unnecessary  splitting  of  the
findings from one research effort into multiple works.

Duplicate  Publication.  Misrepresentation  of  data  as  original  when  they  have  been  published  previously  is  specifically
prohibited by the APA Ethics Code (Standard 8.13, Duplicate Publication of Data). Duplicate publication distorts the knowledge
base by making it appear that more information is available than actually exists. It also wastes scarce resources (journal pages
and  the  time  and  efforts  of  editors  and  reviewers).  The  prohibition  against  duplicate  publication  is  especially  critical  for  the
cumulative  knowledge  of  the  field.  Duplicate  publication  can  give  the  erroneous  impression  that  findings  are  more  replicable
than  is  the  case  or  that  particular  conclusions  are  more  strongly  supported  than  is  warranted  by  the  cumulative  evidence.
Duplicate publication can also lead to copyright violations; authors cannot assign the copyright for the same material to more
than one publisher. When submitting a manuscript for publication, authors are obligated to disclose whether they have posted the
manuscript online, either in full or in substantial part; some editors may consider such posting to be prior publication.

33

Examples of and Exceptions to Duplicate Publication. Authors should not submit manuscripts that have been published in whole
or in substantial part elsewhere, including manuscripts with substantially similar form or content to their previously published
works. This policy also applies to translations; authors are not permitted to publish research in one language and then translate
the article into another language and publish it again. Authors in doubt about what constitutes prior publication should consult
the editor of the journal to which they are submitting their manuscript.

The policy regarding duplicate publication also means that the same or overlapping material that has appeared in a publication
offered for public sale, such as conference proceedings or a book chapter, should not be republished elsewhere because these
sources are considered widely available. For example, a brief report is published in an APA journal with the understanding that
an extended report will not be published elsewhere because APA brief reports include sufficient descriptions of methodology to
allow for replication; the brief report is the archival record for the work.

The policy regarding duplicate publication has some exclusions. Manuscripts previously published in abstracted form (e.g., in
conference  proceedings)  or  in  a  periodical  with  limited  circulation  or  availability  (e.g.,  report  by  a  university  department  or
government  agency,  dissertation)  can  be  published  again  in  a  venue  of  wide  circulation  (e.g.,  in  a  journal).  Consult  a  journal
editor to determine whether a study reported in a dissertation or thesis or posted in a preprint repository could benefit from peer
review and publication as a journal article.

Similarly,  it  is  not  considered  duplicate  publication  to  reanalyze  already  published  data  in  light  of  new  theories  or
methodologies,  if  the  reanalysis  is  clearly  labeled  as  such  and  provides  new  insights  into  the  phenomena  being  studied.  The
policy also does not apply to follow-up studies; for example, researchers may first report the initial findings from a clinical trial
and subsequently report results of a follow-up assessment 2 years after the trial’s completion.

Acknowledging and Citing Previous Work. Authors sometimes want to publish what is essentially the same material in more than
one  venue  to  reach  different  audiences.  Such  duplicate  publication  can  rarely  be  justified,  given  the  ready  accessibility  of
published works online. If authors think it is justified, the article must include a reference to the original report—both to inform
editors, reviewers, and readers and to fulfill the authors’ obligations to the copyright holder of the previous work.

If it is deemed scientifically necessary to represent previously published material—for instance, to report new analyses or to

frame new research that follows up on previous work from the authors’ laboratory—the following conditions must be met:

1. The amount of duplicated material must be small relative to the total length of the text.

2. The authors must clearly acknowledge in the author note and in all relevant sections of the article (e.g., Method, Results)

that the information was reported previously, and the previous work must be cited.

3. The authors must provide a copyright attribution for any reprinted or adapted tables and figures and may need to secure

permission from the copyright holder as well (see Sections 12.14–12.18).

4. The original work must be clearly and accurately cited in the reference list (see also the discussion on self-plagiarism in

Sections 1.17 and 8.3).

When the original work has multiple authors and the authorship of the new work is not identical, all authors of the original work
must provide appropriate copyright permission (see Section 12.20) and receive agreed-upon credit (e.g., in an author note; see
Section 2.7) for their contributions in the later publication.

Piecemeal Publication. Authors are obligated to present work as parsimoniously and completely as possible within the space
constraints of journal articles. Data that can be meaningfully combined within a single article should be presented together to
enhance effective communication.

Piecemeal,  or  fragmented,  publication  of  research  findings  can  be  misleading  if  multiple  reports  appear  to  represent
independent instances of data collection or analyses; distortion of the scientific literature, especially in reviews or meta-analyses,
may result. Piecemeal publication of the results from a single study is therefore undesirable unless there is a clear reason for
doing so. It may be quite difficult to determine whether a valid reason exists; therefore, authors who submit manuscripts based
on studies or data presented in other published or submitted works should inform the journal editor of the source and extent of
the overlap, and they should detail how their submission builds on the previous reports. Whether the publication of two or more
reports based on the same or on closely related research constitutes fragmented publication is a matter of editorial judgment.

Multiple Publications From Large-Scale, Longitudinal Projects and Qualitative and Mixed Methods Research. There are times
when it is both necessary and appropriate to publish multiple reports. Multidisciplinary projects often address diverse topics and

34

answer different questions; thus, publishing the results in a single article may be inappropriate. Similarly, researchers sometimes
design  studies  with  the  purpose  of  addressing  distinct  theoretical  questions  using  the  same  instruments;  if  written  as  separate
research reports, each report should make a unique contribution and not overlap substantially with the others or with previously
published material. Researchers should consider at the outset of data collection how the data will be presented (e.g., in one report
vs.  multiple  reports);  although  new  research  questions  or  analyses  may  arise  in  the  process  of  analyzing  the  data,  researchers
should not fish through the data for the sole purpose of extracting additional studies. Although all reports stem from the same
overall project, the introduction, Results, and Discussion sections of each report would be unique, and at least some aspects of
the Method section would be unique as well.

Longitudinal or large-scale studies are another instance when multiple publications are often appropriate because the data at
different time points make independent scientific contributions. Further, useful knowledge should be made available to others as
soon as possible, which is precluded if publication is delayed until all the studies are complete.

Multiple reports may be needed in some qualitative and mixed methods research when qualitative data collection and analysis
produce volumes of findings that are not appropriate for publication in a single article—for instance, when investigators conduct
interviews to explore questions that have distinct purposes and are meaningful in relation to separate literatures and concerns.
With  mixed  methods  studies,  authors  might  publish  multiple  articles,  such  as  a  qualitative  study,  a  quantitative  study,  and  a
mixed methods overview study, each focusing on new insights based on findings across the methods.

When authors create multiple reports from studies of this sort, they are obligated to cite prior reports on the project to help
readers  understand  the  work  accurately.  For  example,  in  the  early  years  of  a  longitudinal  study,  the  authors  might  cite  all
previous publications from it. For a well-known or long-term longitudinal study, the authors might cite the original publication, a
more recent summary, and earlier articles that focused on the same or related scientific questions addressed in the current report.
It is useful to distinguish between data sets that are complete and data sets that are still in collection. It is not necessary to repeat
the description of the design and methods of prior reports in their entirety; authors may refer readers to an earlier publication for
this  detailed  information.  It  is  important,  however,  to  provide  sufficient  information  so  that  readers  can  evaluate  the  current
report. It is also important to clarify the degree of sample overlap in multiple reports from large studies. Again, authors should
inform and consult with the journal editor before submitting a manuscript of this type.

Whether  the  publication  of  two  or  more  reports  based  on  the  same  or  closely  related  research  constitutes  piecemeal
publication is a matter of editorial judgment, as is the determination of whether the manuscript meets other publication criteria.
Authors should note in the manuscript all prior works related to the study by including them in the reference list and citing them
in the text (see the previous section on acknowledging and citing previous work). When submitting the manuscript, authors must
inform the journal editor in a cover letter of any similar manuscripts that have already been published, accepted for publication,
or submitted for concurrent consideration to the same journal or elsewhere. The editor can then make an informed judgment as
to whether the submitted manuscript includes sufficient new information to warrant consideration. If the authors’ identities are
masked for review, references to previous work should be concealed as well until after the review process.

If, during the review or production process, a manuscript is discovered to be in violation of duplicate or piecemeal publication
policies  and  the  authors  failed  to  inform  the  editor  of  the  potential  for  violation,  then  the  manuscript  can  be  rejected  without
further consideration. If such a violation is discovered after publication in an APA journal, appropriate action, such as retraction
by the publisher or notice of duplicate publication, can be taken.

Republication  of  an  Article  as  a  Book  Chapter.  Journal  articles  sometimes  are  revised  for  publication  as  book  chapters.
Authors  have  a  responsibility  to  reveal  to  readers  that  portions  of  the  new  work  were  previously  published  and  to  cite  and
reference  the  source.  If  copyright  is  owned  by  a  publisher  or  by  another  person,  authors  must  obtain  permission  to  reprint  or
adapt the work and include a copyright attribution in the chapter (see Sections 12.14–12.18).

1.17 Implications of Plagiarism and Self-Plagiarism
Plagiarism is the act of presenting the words, ideas, or images of another as one’s own; it denies authors credit where credit is
due.  Whether  deliberate  or  unintentional,  plagiarism  violates  ethical  standards  in  scholarship  (see  APA  Ethics  Code  Standard
8.11,  Plagiarism)  and  has  profound  real-world  effects.  Authors  who  try  to  publish  plagiarized  work  face  rejection  from
publication,  as  well  as  possible  sanction  by  professional  bodies,  censure  in  their  place  of  employment,  and/or  exclusion  from
applying for federal funding. Students who turn in a plagiarized assignment face a failing grade, as well as possible censure from
a  student  or  university  honor  board,  suspension,  or  expulsion.  Self-plagiarism  is  the  act  of  presenting  one’s  own  previously
published work as original; it misleads readers and falsely inflates the number of publications on a topic. Like plagiarism, self-

35

plagiarism is unethical. To learn more about what constitutes plagiarism and self-plagiarism and how to avoid both, see Sections
8.2 and 8.3.

Protecting the Rights and Welfare of Research Participants and Subjects

1.18 Rights and Welfare of Research Participants and Subjects

The  APA  Ethics  Code  (Sections  3  and  8)  specifies  the  standards  psychologists  are  to  follow  when  conducting  research  with
human participants and nonhuman animal subjects. Both humans and nonhuman animals in research studies have the right to
ethical and humane treatment. Research with human participants involves additional rights and welfare protections; for example,
researchers are required to

obtain  informed  consent,  assent,  or  permission,  as  appropriate,  using  language  that  is  reasonably  understood  by  research
participants;

avoid or minimize participants’ exposure to

physical, emotional, or psychological harm;
exploitative relationships;
undue influence based on the researchers’ status, power, or authority;
excessive or inappropriate inducements to participate; and
unjustified or unduly delayed deception or debriefing procedures; and

take adequate measures to prevent unauthorized access to or release of participant data to the public or other researchers not
specified in the informed consent (e.g., by obtaining prior written agreement for sharing of research data).

Nonhuman  animal  subjects  are  to  be  cared  for  humanely  and  provided  with  healthful  conditions  during  their  stay  in  research
facilities. The protocol for research with nonhuman animals must be reviewed by an appropriate animal care committee (e.g., an
IACUC) before it is conducted to ensure that the procedures are appropriate and humane (APA, 2012a).

Researchers who are APA members, regardless of field, are required to certify that they have followed ethical standards as a
precondition of publishing their articles in most journals, including APA journals (see Section 12.13). We encourage authors to
include in the text of their manuscripts certifications that their research followed ethical and institutional guidelines, as described
in  the  APA  journal  article  reporting  standards  in  Chapter  3.  For  instance,  if  research  participants  consented  to  having  their
identifying information disclosed (e.g., their name), the authors should indicate in the Method section of the article that consent
was  given.  Failure  to  follow  these  standards  can  be  grounds  for  rejecting  a  manuscript  for  publication  or  for  retracting  a
published article.

1.19 Protecting Confidentiality
When  authors  describe  their  research,  they  are  prohibited  from  disclosing  “confidential,  personally  identifiable  information
concerning  their  clients/patients,  students,  research  participants,  organizational  clients,  or  other  recipients  of  their  services”
(APA  Ethics  Code  Standard  4.07,  Use  of  Confidential  Information  for  Didactic  or  Other  Purposes)  unless  participants  give
documented consent to disclose their identities. The exact requirements for documentation vary depending on the nature of the
consent obtained and the type of study.

Confidentiality in case studies can, at times, be difficult to achieve. For example, the researcher might obtain written consent
from the subject of the report to publish the study. The researcher must be careful not to exploit the subject—for example, when
the researcher has supervisory, evaluative, or other authority over them, as in the case of a client, patient, supervisee, employee,
or  organizational  client  (see  APA  Ethics  Code  Standard  3.08,  Exploitative  Relationships,  and  Standard  3.05,  Multiple
Relationships).

In  some  types  of  qualitative  research  (e.g.,  participatory  action  research,  autoethnography),  the  participants  may  be
investigators  and  authors,  meaning  they  will  be  personally  identifiable.  Participant-authors  or  participant-investigators  should
retain  control  over  what  information  about  them  is  presented  in  the  report  (see  Section  1.15  for  more  on  sharing  data  from
qualitative research).

Strategies to Disguise Identifying Material. Researchers can protect confidentiality by disguising some aspects of the data so
that neither the subject nor third parties (e.g., family members, employers) are identifiable. Four main strategies are used: (a)
altering  specific  characteristics,  (b)  limiting  the  description  of  specific  characteristics,  (c)  obfuscating  case  detail  by  adding

36

extraneous material, and (d) using composite descriptions. Disguising identifying information must be done carefully because it
is  essential  not  to  change  variables  in  a  way  that  would  lead  readers  to  draw  false  conclusions  (Sweeney  et  al.,  2015).  For
example, altering a person’s gender in a case illustrating a promising therapy for sexual assault trauma might compromise its
educative value if the person’s gender played a significant role in the treatment. Subject details should be omitted only if they are
not essential to the phenomenon being described. Confidentiality, however, should never be sacrificed for clinical or scientific
accuracy. Reports that cannot adequately disguise identifiable subject information should not be submitted for publication. For
examples of how to incorporate case material (e.g., quotations from research participants) into the text, see Section 8.36.

Data  Deidentification.  Extra  steps  may  be  needed  to  protect  participants’  confidentiality  when  working  with  data  sets
containing multiple forms of data or protected health information. The HIPAA website provides guidance on deidentifying data
(see  https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html).  Researchers  have  also
developed  methods  for  deidentifying  various  kinds  of  data;  see,  for  example,  the  work  of  the  Data  Privacy  Lab
(https://dataprivacylab.org/projects/index.html).

1.20 Conflict of Interest
In  the  APA  Ethics  Code  (Standard  3.06,  Conflict  of  Interest),  conflict  of  interest  is  defined  broadly  as  involving  “personal,
scientific, professional, legal, financial, or other interests or relationships” that could negatively affect professional conduct or
cause harm to persons with whom a professional interacts (see also Sections 2.7 and 12.13).  Thus,  the  main  concerns  when  a
conflict  of  interest  arises  in  publishing  are  the  impairment  of  objectivity  in  both  performing  and  evaluating  research  and  the
potential for harm to or exploitation of research participants.

Author Interest. In all scientific disciplines, professional communications are presumed to be based on objective and unbiased
interpretations of evidence. Transparency about researchers’ positions in relation to their evidence and interpretations is central.
For example, authors’ economic and commercial interests in products or services used in a study or discussed in a manuscript
may  color  their  ability  to  collect  evidence  and  interpret  it  with  fidelity.  Although  the  presence  of  such  interests  does  not
necessarily constitute an unethical conflict of interest per se, the integrity of the field requires open and honest disclosure of the
possibilities of such influences when they may exist. In general, an author’s safest and most transparent course of action is to
disclose in an author note activities and relationships that, if known to others, might be viewed as a conflict of interest, even if
the author does not believe that any conflict or bias exists.

Whether an interest is significant depends on individual circumstances and cannot be defined by a threshold amount. Holdings
in  a  company  through  a  mutual  fund  are  not  ordinarily  sufficient  to  warrant  disclosure,  whereas  salaries,  research  grants,
consulting fees, and personal stock holdings should be disclosed. Participation on a board of directors or any other relationship
with an entity that is in some way part of the research project should also be carefully considered for possible disclosure.

In addition to disclosing possible influences that might lead authors to support certain findings, authors should also consider
disclosing  when  circumstances  could  influence  them  against  a  product,  service,  facility,  or  person.  For  example,  having  a
copyright  or  royalty  interest  in  a  competing  psychological  test  or  assessment  protocol  might  be  seen  as  a  possible  source  of
negative bias against another test instrument (American Educational Research Association et al., 2014).

Editor and Reviewer Interest. For editors and reviewers who evaluate a given manuscript for publication, conflicts of interest
are  defined  more  broadly  than  economic  interests  and  are  usually  dealt  with  by  recusal  rather  than  disclosure.  It  is  the
responsibility of editors and reviewers to recognize their conflicts of interest, disclose these conflicts to the person who assigned
them the manuscript, and either decline the request or ask the assigning person to make a decision.

For editors and reviewers, conflicts of interest may be economic, as described previously for authors. If the main topic of an
article has direct implications for a commercial interest of the editor or reviewer, that individual should decline the request to
review  the  article.  Any  other  economic  conflicts  that  bear  on  the  review  are  for  the  person  who  assigned  the  manuscript  to
decide.

Conflicts of interest for editors and reviewers may also take the form of personal connections. Having a family tie, marital
relationship,  close  friendship,  or  romantic  connection  with  an  author  is  generally  seen  as  a  conflict  of  interest.  Professional
relationships  also  may  constitute  a  conflict  of  interest  if,  for  example,  one  of  the  authors  is  a  coauthor,  past  or  current
collaborator, past doctoral student or supervisor, or current colleague of the editor or reviewer. Editors-in-chief should set policy
for their journal about whether collaboration-based conflicts extend for a lifetime or elapse after a certain number of years have

37

passed. If an editor or reviewer guesses the identity of an anonymized author, and there is potential for a personal conflict, the
editor or reviewer should make the assigning person aware of this.

Although differences of scientific or political opinion may influence evaluation of a manuscript, it is impractical to define any
opinion-based agreement or disagreement as constituting a disqualifying conflict of interest. However, if an editor or reviewer
finds that their point of view is fundamentally opposed to the rationale or approach of a manuscript, they should let the assigning
person  know  this.  For  their  part,  editors  should  seek  opinions  from  reviewers  with  a  variety  of  positions  when  evaluating  a
manuscript known to be controversial.

Protecting Intellectual Property Rights

1.21 Publication Credit

Authorship is reserved for persons who make a substantial contribution to and who accept responsibility for a published work.
Individuals  should  take  authorship  credit  only  for  work  they  have  performed  or  to  which  they  have  substantially  contributed
(APA Ethics Code Standard 8.12a, Publication Credit). Authorship encompasses, therefore, not only persons who do the writing
but also those who have made substantial scientific contributions to a study. Substantial professional contributions may include
formulating  the  problem  or  hypothesis,  structuring  the  experimental  study  design,  organizing  and  conducting  the  analysis,  or
interpreting the results and findings. Those who so contribute are listed as authors in the byline. Lesser contributions, which do
not constitute authorship, may be acknowledged in the author note (see Section 2.7; see also a taxonomy of authorship in the
natural  sciences  called  CRediT  at  https://casrai.org/credit).  Lesser  contributions  may  include  such  supportive  functions  as
designing or building the study apparatus, suggesting or advising about the analysis, collecting or entering the data, modifying or
structuring a computer program, recruiting participants, and obtaining animals. Conducting routine observations or diagnoses for
use in studies does not constitute authorship. Combinations of these (and other) tasks, however, may justify authorship.

As  early  as  practicable  in  a  research  project,  the  collaborators  should  decide  which  tasks  are  necessary  for  the  project’s
completion, how the work will be divided, which tasks or combination of tasks merits authorship credit, and on what level credit
will  be  given  (first  author,  second  author,  etc.).  Collaborators  may  need  to  reassess  authorship  credit  and  order  if  relative
contributions change in the course of the project (and its publication). This is especially true in faculty–student collaborations
when  students  need  more  intensive  supervision  than  originally  anticipated,  when  additional  analyses  are  required  beyond  the
scope  of  a  student’s  current  level  of  training,  or  when  the  level  of  the  student’s  contribution  exceeds  what  was  originally
anticipated.

When a manuscript is accepted for publication, each person listed in the byline must verify in writing that they (a) agree to

serve as an author, (b) approve the order of authorship presented in the byline, and (c) accept the responsibilities of authorship.

1.22 Order of Authors
Professional Authors. Authors are responsible for determining authorship and for specifying the order in which two or more
authors’ names appear in the byline. Principal authorship and the order of authorship credit should accurately reflect the relative
contributions of persons involved (APA Ethics Code Standard 8.12b, Publication Credit). Relative status (e.g., department chair,
junior faculty member, student) should not determine the order of authorship. The general rule is that the name of the principal
contributor appears first, with subsequent names appearing in order of decreasing contribution. In some cases, another principal
contributor appears last. These conventions can vary from field to field and from journal to journal. Novice authors are advised
to contact the editor of the journal to which they are submitting a manuscript for guidance. If authors played equal roles in the
research and publication of their study, they may wish to note this in the author note (see Section 2.7).

Professional–Student Collaborations. Because doctoral work is expected to result in an independent and original contribution
to the field by the student, except under rare circumstances, the student should be listed as the principal author of any papers
with  multiple  authors  that  are  substantially  based  on  their  dissertation  (APA  Ethics  Code  Standard  8.12c,  Publication  Credit).
Unusual exceptions to doctoral student first authorship might occur when the dissertation is published as part of a collection of
studies  involving  other  researchers  or  when  work  on  a  final  manuscript  was  performed  substantially  by  a  coauthor.  Whether
students merit principal authorship on papers based on master’s-level or other predoctoral research will depend on their specific
contributions to the research. When master’s-level students make the primary contribution to a study, they should be listed as the
first author. Students may also collaborate with a faculty member on a faculty-originated project as a way to acquire the skills to

38

make a primary scientific contribution in their master’s thesis. In such cases, authorship should be determined by the relative
contributions of the student and faculty member to the project (Fisher, 2017).

Student  Assignments.  When  students  contribute  equally  to  a  group  project  that  will  be  submitted  to  an  instructor  (not  for
publication), students may put their names in any order in the byline (e.g., alphabetical order, reverse alphabetical order).

1.23 Authors’ Intellectual Property Rights During Manuscript Review
Editorial review of a manuscript requires that the editors and reviewers circulate and discuss the manuscript. During the review
process, the manuscript is a confidential and privileged document. Editors and reviewers may not, without the authors’ explicit
permission, quote from a manuscript under review or circulate copies of it to others, including graduate or postdoctoral students,
for  any  purpose  other  than  editorial  review  (APA  Ethics  Code  Standard  8.15,  Reviewers;  see  Section  12.7  for  a  detailed
discussion of the peer review process). If a reviewer wishes to consult with a colleague about some aspect of the manuscript, the
reviewer must request permission from the editor prior to approaching the colleague. Publishers have different policies on how
editorial review works, and reviewers should consult the editor for any questions. In addition, editors and reviewers may not use
material from an unpublished manuscript to advance their own or others’ work without the authors’ consent.

1.24 Authors’ Copyright on Unpublished Manuscripts
Authors are protected by federal statute against unauthorized use of their unpublished manuscripts. Under the Copyright Act of
1976  (Title  17  of  the  United  States  Code),  an  unpublished  work  is  copyrighted  “automatically  from  the  moment  the  original
work of authorship is fixed” (U.S. Copyright Office, 2017, p. 1), referring to the moment in which a work exists in any tangible
form—for example, typed on a page. Until authors formally transfer copyright (see Section 12.20), they own the copyright on an
unpublished  manuscript;  all  exclusive  rights  due  the  copyright  owner  of  a  published  work  are  also  due  the  authors  of  an
unpublished  work.  To  ensure  copyright  protection,  publishers  include  the  copyright  notice  on  all  published  works  (e.g.,
Copyright  [year]  by  [name  of  copyright  holder]).  The  notice  need  not  appear  on  unpublished  works;  nonetheless,  it  is
recommended  that  authors  include  a  copyright  notice  on  all  works,  whether  published  or  not.  Registration  of  copyright  (e.g.,
with the U.S. Copyright Office at https://www.copyright.gov/registration/) provides a public record and is usually a prerequisite
for any legal action.

1.25 Ethical Compliance Checklist
The following checklist provides general guidance for ensuring compliance with ethics requirements.

Ethical Compliance Checklist

Have you obtained written permission for use of unpublished instruments, procedures, or data that other researchers might consider
theirs (proprietary)?

Have  you  properly  cited  all  published  works,  unpublished  works,  and  ideas  and  creations  of  others  presented  in  your  manuscript?
Have you secured needed permissions and written copyright attributions for items that require them?

Have you reported institutional review of your study or studies in the Method section of your manuscript?

Are you prepared to answer editorial questions about the informed consent, assent, and/or debriefing procedures you used?

If  your  study  involved  nonhuman  animal  subjects,  are  you  prepared  to  answer  editorial  questions  about  the  humane  care  and
treatment of such animals?

Have all authors reviewed the manuscript and agreed on responsibility for its content?

Have you adequately protected the confidentiality of research participants, clients/patients, organizations, third parties, or others who
were a source of information presented in the manuscript?

Have you released or shared participant data only in accordance with the agreement specified in the informed consent for your study?

If your study was a clinical trial and has been registered, have you reported its registration in the author note and in the text?

PA PER  ELEM EN TS A N D  FOR M AT

Consistency  in  the  order,  structure,  and  format  of  paper  elements  allows  readers  to  focus  on  a  paper’s  content  rather  than  its
presentation. Following APA Style guidelines to achieve consistency in the presentation of paper elements is essential to crafting
an effective scholarly work.

In this chapter, we provide an overview of the elements of a paper, including how to structure, format, and organize them.
These  guidelines  apply  broadly  to  any  APA  Style  paper  and  may  be  especially  useful  to  students  or  researchers  who  are  not
familiar  with  APA  Style.  For  researchers  preparing  manuscripts  for  publication,  more  in-depth  guidelines  on  journal  article
reporting standards (JARS) for quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods research are discussed in Chapter 3.  Students  can
find guidance on dissertations and theses in Sections 1.10 and 12.1.  Sample  APA  Style  papers  are  included  at  the  end  of  this
chapter; additional sample papers are available on the APA Style website (https://apastyle.apa.org).

Required Elements

2.1 Professional Paper Required Elements

Paper elements appear in various combinations depending on the nature of the work. Manuscripts submitted for publication (see
Sections 1.1 –1.9) should always include a title page (see Section 2.3), which contains the paper title (see Section 2.4),  author
names  and  affiliations  (see  Sections 2.5 –2.6),  and  author  note  (see  Section 2.7);  page  headers  with  a  running  head  and  page
numbers (see Sections 2.8 and 2.18); an abstract (see Section 2.9); text (see Section 2.11); and a reference list (see Section 2.12).
Papers may also include keywords (see Section 2.10), footnotes (see Section 2.13), tables (see Chapter 7), figures (see Chapter
7), appendices (see Section 2.14), and/or supplemental materials (see Section 2.15). Authors seeking publication should refer to
the  journal’s  instructions  for  authors  or  manuscript  submission  guidelines  for  any  requirements  that  are  different  from  or  in
addition to those specified by APA Style.

2.2 Student Paper Required Elements
Student papers (e.g., narrative essays, reaction or response papers, literature review papers; see Section 1.10) usually include, at
minimum, a title page (see Sections 2.3 –2.6), page numbers (see Section 2.18), text (see Section 2.11), and a reference list (see
Section 2.12). They may also have tables (see Chapter 7), figures (see Chapter 7), and/or appendices (see Section 2.14). Student
papers do not typically include a running head, an author note, or an abstract, unless specifically requested by the instructor or
institution. Student papers have a student-specific version of the title page (see Section 2.3).

Paper Elements

2.3 Title Page

A title page is required for all APA Style papers. There are both professional and student versions of the title page.

Professional Title Page. The professional title page (see Figure 2.1) includes the following elements:

title of the paper (see Section 2.4),

42

name of each author of the paper (the byline; see Section 1.22 for determining the order of authorship and Section 2.5 for
formatting the byline),

affiliation for each author (see Section 2.6),

author note (see Section 2.7),

running head (also included on all pages; see Section 2.8), and

page number (also included on all pages; see Section 2.18).

43

Full Description.

See the section indicated for each element for formatting instructions.

44

Student Title Page. Students should follow the guidelines of their instructor or institution when determining which title page
format is most appropriate to use. If not instructed otherwise, students should include the following elements on the title page
(see Figure 2.2):

title of the paper (see Section 2.4);

name of each author of the paper (the byline; see Section 1.22 for determining the order of authorship and Section 2.5 for
formatting the byline);

affiliation for each author, typically the university attended (including the name of any department or division; see Section
2.6);

course  number  and  name  for  which  the  paper  is  being  submitted  (use  the  format  shown  on  institutional  materials;  e.g.,
PSY204, PSYC 4301, NURS 303);

instructor name (check with the instructor for the preferred form; e.g., Dr. Hülya F. Akış; Professor Levin; Kwame Osei, PhD;
Mariam Sherzai, RN);

assignment  due  date,  written  in  the  month,  date,  and  year  format  used  in  your  country  (usually  November  4,  2020,  or  4
November  2020;  we  recommend  spelling  out  the  month,  although  2020-11-04  is  the  format  in  countries  that  use  the
international standard date); and

page number (also included on all pages; see Section 2.18).

45

Figure 2.2 Sample Student Title Page

Full Description.

See the sections for the title, byline, affiliation, and page numbers for formatting instructions for these elements. Place the course
number and name, instructor name, and assignment due date on separate lines, centered and in that order, below the affiliation
(see Section 2.21 for more on line spacing).

2.4 Title
The title should summarize the main idea of the paper simply and, if possible, in a way that is engaging for readers. For research
papers, it should be a concise statement of the main topic of the research and should identify the variables or theoretical issues
under  investigation  and  the  relationship  between  them.  Although  there  is  no  prescribed  limit  for  title  length  in  APA  Style,
authors  are  encouraged  to  keep  their  titles  focused  and  succinct.  Research  has  shown  an  association  between  simple,  concise
titles and higher numbers of article downloads and citations (Hallock & Dillner, 2016; Jamali & Nikzad, 2011).

46

Include  essential  terms  in  the  title  to  enhance  readers’  ability  to  find  your  work  during  a  search  and  to  aid  abstracting  and
indexing in databases if the work is published. Avoid words that serve no purpose; they increase the title length and can mislead
indexers. For example, the words “method” and “results” do not normally appear in a title, nor should such phrases as “a study
of” or “an experimental investigation of.” Occasionally terms such as “research synthesis,” “meta-analysis,” or “fMRI study”
convey important information for potential readers and are included in the title. Avoid using abbreviations in a title; spelling out
all terms helps ensure accurate, complete indexing of the article and allows readers to more readily comprehend its meaning.
When an animal name —for example, “Rat” —is in the title, also include the scientific name in italics and parentheses —(Rattus
norvegicus). See Table 2.1 for examples of effective versus ineffective paper titles.

More informative: A creative title has been balanced with
a substantive subtitle.

Format. The paper title should be in title case (see Section 6.17), bold, centered, and positioned in the upper half of the title
page (e.g., three or four lines down from the top margin of the page). Move the title up to accommodate a longer author note if
necessary. If the title is longer than one line, the main title and the subtitle can be separated on double-spaced lines if desired.
Note that the paper title also appears at the top of the first page of text (see Sections 2.11 and 2.28).

2.5 Author Name (Byline)
Every  paper  includes  the  name  of  the  author  or  authors —the  byline.  The  preferred  form  of  an  author’s  name  is  first  name,
middle initial(s), and last name; this form reduces the likelihood of mistaken identity (e.g., that authors with the same first and
last names are the same person). To assist researchers and librarians, use the same form of your name for publication throughout
your  career  when  possible;  for  example,  do  not  use  a  middle  initial  on  one  paper  and  omit  the  initial  on  a  different  paper.
Determining whether, for example, Marisol G. Rodríguez is the same person as M. G. Rodríguez can be difficult, particularly
when citations span years and institutional affiliations change. If you change your name during your career, present your new
name in a consistent form as well. Omit all professional titles (e.g., Dr., Professor) and academic degrees or licenses (e.g., PhD,
EdD, MD, MA, RN, MSW, LCSW) from the byline.

Format. Write the byline on the title page after the paper title. Include one blank double-spaced line between the paper title and
the byline. Follow these guidelines for byline formatting:

If the paper has one author, write the author name centered and in standard (i.e., nonbold, nonitalic) font.

If the paper has multiple authors, order the names of the authors according to their contributions. Write all names on the same
line (flowing onto additional lines if needed), centered, and in standard font. For two authors, separate the names with the
word “and”; for three or more authors, separate the names with commas and include “and” before the final author’s name.

For names with suffixes, separate the suffix from the rest of the name with a space, not a comma (e.g., Roland J. Thorpe Jr.).

See Table 2.2 for examples of how to set up author bylines and affiliations.

3 Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge

2.6 Author Affiliation
The affiliation identifies where the author(s) worked (or studied, in the case of student authors) when the work was conducted,
which is usually a university or other institution. Include a dual affiliation only if two institutions contributed substantial support
to the study. Include no more than two affiliations per author. If the affiliation has changed since the work was completed, give
the current affiliation in the author note (see Section 2.7). Abide by these guidelines when presenting affiliations:

Academic  affiliations  (e.g.,  universities,  teaching  hospitals  affiliated  with  a  university)  should  include  the  name  of  any
department or division and the name of the institution, separated by a comma. It is not necessary to include the location of the
institution unless the location is part of the institution’s name.

Nonacademic  institutional  affiliations  (e.g.,  hospitals  not  affiliated  with  a  university,  independent  laboratories,  other
organizations)  should  include  the  name  of  any  department  or  division,  the  name  of  the  institution,  and  the  location  of  the
institution, separated by commas.

Authors who are in private practice or who have no institutional affiliation should include their location.

When providing a location (as for nonacademic institutions and private practices), give the city; state, province, or territory as
applicable; and country. Spell out state, province, and territory names rather than abbreviating them.

Format. The format of the affiliation depends on the number of authors and whether different authors have different affiliations,
as follows. Begin the affiliation(s) on a new line after the byline. Place different affiliations on their own lines. Do not add blank
lines  between  affiliations  or  between  the  byline  and  the  first  affiliation.  See  Table 2.2  for  examples  of  how  to  set  up  author
bylines and affiliations.

All Authors Share One Affiliation. If the paper has one author with one affiliation, or if all authors of a multiauthored paper share
one affiliation, include the affiliation centered and in standard font on its own line, beginning one line below the byline. Do not
include a superscript numeral.

All Authors Share Two Affiliations. If the paper has one author with two affiliations, or if all authors of a multiauthored paper
share the same two affiliations, include each affiliation centered and in standard font on its own line, beginning one line below
the byline. Do not include superscript numerals.

Multiple Authors With Different Affiliations. If  the  paper  has  two  or  more  authors  with  different  affiliations  (even  if  only  the
department is different within the same university), use superscript Arabic numerals to connect author names to the appropriate
affiliation(s). List authors’ affiliations in the order the authors appear in the byline; for example, for a paper with two authors

48

who have different affiliations, list the affiliation of the first author first, followed by the affiliation of the second author, with
each affiliation centered and in standard font on its own line, beginning one line below the byline. Place a superscript numeral 1
after the first author’s surname, without a space between the name and the numeral (when a paper has three or more authors and
thus commas appear after author names, put the numeral after the surname and before the comma). Then put a corresponding
superscript  numeral  1  before  the  corresponding  affiliation  (with  a  space  between  the  numeral  and  the  start  of  the  affiliation).
Repeat this process for the second author using the numeral 2 (and so on when a paper has more authors).

If  some,  but  not  all,  authors  share  an  affiliation,  list  the  affiliation  once  and  reuse  the  superscript  numeral  in  the  byline.
Identify authors with two affiliations in the byline by separating the appropriate superscript numerals with a superscript comma
and space.

If the paper has only one author, or if there are multiple authors but all authors share the same one or two affiliations, then

superscript numerals are not used.

Group Authors. For group authors (e.g., task forces, working groups, organizations), superscript numerals are not usually used
because the group is essentially its own affiliation.

2.7 Author Note
An  author  note  provides  additional  information  about  authors,  study  registration,  data  sharing,  disclaimers  or  statements
regarding conflicts of interest, and help or funding that supported the research. It also provides a point of contact for interested
readers. Student papers do not typically include an author note.

Arrange the author note into separate paragraphs; if a paragraph is not applicable to your manuscript, omit it from the author
note.  Also,  the  following  requirements  apply  for  manuscripts  submitted  to  APA  journals;  other  publishers  may  have  different
requirements (e.g., some journals require authors to provide disclosures and acknowledgments on a separate page at the end of
the manuscript rather than in the author note).

First Paragraph: ORCID iDs. Authors may include their ORCID identification number (iD), if they have one (see the ORCID
website at https://orcid.org/ for more information). ORCID iDs help authors who have changed names or who share the same
name ensure publications are correctly attributed to them. Provide the author’s name, the ORCID iD symbol, and the full URL
for the ORCID iD, listing each author on a separate, indented line. The iD symbol should be included in the link, per ORCID’s
recommendation.

Josiah S. Carberry

 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097

Sofia Maria Hernandez Garcia

 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5727-2427

Include only the names of authors who have ORCID iDs. If no authors have ORCID iDs, omit this paragraph.

Second Paragraph: Changes of Affiliation. Identify any changes in author affiliation subsequent to the time of the study. Use
the following wording: “[Author’s name] is now at [affiliation].” This paragraph may also be used to acknowledge the death of
an author.

Third Paragraph: Disclosures and Acknowledgments. If the disclosures and acknowledgments are short, combine them into
one paragraph; if they are long, separate them into multiple paragraphs.

Study Registration. If the study was registered, provide the registry name and document entry number in the author note. Clinical
trials and meta-analyses are often registered. For example, write “This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier
NCT998877).” For more information on study registration information as it pertains to JARS, see Section 3.9.

Open Practices and Data Sharing. If the study data and/or materials are to be shared openly as part of the publication of the
article (see also Section 1.14), acknowledge this in the author note. Cite the data set in the author note, and include the reference
for the data set in the reference list (see Section 10.9).

Disclosure of Related Reports and Conflicts of Interest. If the article is based on data used in a previously published report (e.g.,
a longitudinal study), doctoral dissertation, or conference presentation, disclose this information, and include an in-text citation.
For  example,  write  “This  article  is  based  on  data  published  in  Pulaski  (2017)”  or  “This  article  is  based  on  the  dissertation
completed by Graham (2018)” and include an entry for Pulaski (2017) or Graham (2018) in the reference list. Also acknowledge
the publication of related reports (e.g., reports on the same data). In addition, indicate in this paragraph whether any author has a

49

possible or perceived conflict of interest (e.g., ownership of stock in a company that manufactures a drug used in the study); if
not, state that no conflict of interest exists. If your employer or granting organization requires a disclaimer stating, for example,
that the research reported does not reflect the views of that organization, include such a statement in this paragraph and follow
the format or wording prescribed by that organization.

Acknowledgments  of  Financial  Support  and  Other  Assistance.  Complete  and  accurate  funding  information  for  your  article
should be included in the author note. Report the names of all funding organizations; all grant, fellowship, or award numbers
and/or names; the names of the funding recipients; and the names of principal investigators (if any) for the funded research. Do
not  precede  grant  numbers  by  “No.”  or  “#”  (e.g.,  write  “We  received  funding  from  Grant  A-123  from  the  National  Science
Foundation”  or  “National  Science  Foundation  Grant  A-123  funded  this  work,”  not  “Grant  No.  A-123”  or  “Grant  #A-123”).
Next, acknowledge colleagues who assisted in conducting the study or critiquing the manuscript but who are not authors of the
work. Study participants may be acknowledged for exceptional contributions if desired. Then provide any thanks for personal
assistance,  such  as  in  manuscript  preparation  or  copyediting.  End  this  paragraph  by  explaining  any  special  agreements
concerning authorship, such as if authors contributed equally to the study. Do not acknowledge the people routinely involved in
the  review  and  acceptance  of  manuscripts  in  this  paragraph,  such  as  peer  reviewers,  editors,  associate  editors,  and  consulting
editors of the journal to which you are submitting the manuscript. If you would like to acknowledge a specific idea raised by a
reviewer or journal editor, do so in a footnote in the text where the idea is discussed.

Fourth Paragraph: Contact Information. The corresponding author answers queries regarding the work after it is published
and  ensures  that  any  data  are  retained  for  the  appropriate  amount  of  time.  Any  author  can  serve  as  the  corresponding  author.
Provide  the  full  name  and  complete  mailing  address  for  the  corresponding  author,  with  the  name  and  address  separated  by  a
comma and a period after the address. Then provide the corresponding author’s email address, with no period after it. Use the
following format:

Correspondence  concerning
author@institution.edu

this  article  should  be  addressed

to

[author’s  name],

[complete  mailing  address].  Email:

Format. Place the author note in the bottom half of the title page, below the title, byline, and affiliation. Leave at least one blank
line  between  the  affiliation  and  the  author  note  label.  Center  the  label  “Author  Note”  (in  bold).  Indent  each  paragraph  of  the
author note and align paragraphs to the left. Although the paragraphs of the author note are labeled in this section to help explain
them, do not label the paragraphs of the author note in your paper. See Figure 2.3 for a sample author note.

Figure 2.3 Sample Author Note

Full Description.

2.8 Running Head
The running  head  is  an  abbreviated  version  of  the  paper  title  that  appears  at  the  top  of  every  page  to  identify  it  for  readers,
especially readers of a print copy of the published article. Running heads are required only for manuscripts being submitted for
publication. Running heads are not required for student papers unless the instructor or institution requests them; thus, the header
for a student paper includes only the page number.

Authors should supply the running head rather than leave this task to the publisher because authors are best able to select the
most important words for an abbreviated title. The running head does not have to consist of the same words in the same order as
the  title;  rather,  the  idea  of  the  title  should  be  conveyed  in  a  shortened  form.  For  example,  an  article  titled  “Restless  Nights:
Sleep  Latency  Increases  and  Sleep  Quality  Decreases  With  Caffeine  Intake”  can  have  a  running  head  of  “CAFFEINE-
INDUCED REDUCTIONS IN SLEEP EFFICIENCY.”

The  running  head  should  contain  a  maximum  of  50  characters,  counting  letters,  punctuation,  and  spaces  between  words  as
characters. If the title is already 50 characters or fewer, the full title can be used as the running head. Avoid using abbreviations
in the running head; however, the ampersand symbol (&) may be used rather than “and” if desired.

Format. Write the running head in the page header, flush left, in all-capital letters, across from the right-aligned page number.
Use  the  same  running  head  on  every  page,  including  the  title  page;  do  not  include  the  label  “Running  head”  to  identify  the
running head on any page (see the sample papers at the end of this chapter).

2.9 Abstract
An abstract is a brief, comprehensive summary of the contents of the paper. Authors writing for publication should follow the
reporting standards for abstracts presented in Section 3.3. Most scholarly journals require an abstract. For any journal-specific
instructions,  consult  the  instructions  for  authors  or  the  webpage  of  the  journal  to  which  you  plan  to  submit  your  article.  For

51

example, some journals publish a public significance statement, which summarizes the significance of the study for a general
audience,  along  with  the  abstract.  An  abstract  is  not  usually  required  for  student  papers  unless  requested  by  the  instructor  or
institution.

Format.  Abstracts  typically  are  limited  to  no  more  than  250  words.  If  you  are  submitting  a  work  for  publication,  check  the
journal’s  instructions  for  authors  for  abstract  length  and  formatting  requirements,  which  may  be  different  from  those  of  APA
journals. Place the abstract on its own page after the title page (i.e., page 2). Write the section label “Abstract” in bold title case,
centered at the top of the page, and place the abstract below the label.

Abstracts  may  appear  in  paragraph  or  structured  format.  Abstracts  in  paragraph  format  are  written  as  a  single  paragraph
without indentation of the first line. Structured abstracts are also written as a single paragraph without indentation, and labels are
inserted to identify various sections (e.g., Objective, Method, Results, Conclusions); use the labels and formatting prescribed by
the journal to which you are submitting your manuscript (e.g., APA journals use bold italic for the labels).

2.10 Keywords
Keywords are words, phrases, or acronyms that describe the most important aspects of your paper. They are used for indexing in
databases and help readers find your work during a search. For manuscripts being submitted to APA journals, provide three to
five  keywords  describing  the  content.  Keywords  are  not  required  for  student  papers  unless  requested  by  the  instructor  or
institution.

Format. Write the label “Keywords:” (in italic) one line below the abstract, indented 0.5 in. like a regular paragraph, followed
by the keywords in lowercase (but capitalize proper nouns; see Section 6.14), separated by commas. The keywords can be listed
in any order. Do not use a period or other punctuation after the last keyword (see the sample professional paper at the end of this
chapter). If the keywords run onto a second line, the second line is not indented.

2.11 Text (Body)
The text, or body of the paper, contains the authors’ main contribution to the literature. Both professional and student authors
should follow the content and formatting guidelines described in this chapter and the citation principles described in Chapters 8
and 9; researchers preparing manuscripts for publication should also review the reporting standards for quantitative, qualitative,
or mixed methods research, as appropriate, described in Chapter 3. For guidance on the contents of various types of papers, see
Sections 1.1 to 1.10.

The text can be organized in many ways, and the organization generally depends on the paper type (see also Sections 1.1 –
1.10). Most papers include an introduction that addresses the importance of the work, contextualizes the work within the existing
literature, and states the aims of the work. Beyond the introduction, the paper should include paragraphs or sections explaining
the main premises of the paper. There are many possible formats for the rest of the text; for example, a quantitative research
paper  typically  includes  sections  called  “Method,”  “Results,”  and  “Discussion,”  whereas  a  qualitative  research  paper  may
include a section called “Findings” instead of “Results,” or it may have different section headings altogether, depending on the
nature of the inquiry. A brief student paper (e.g., a response paper) may not have section headings or may have sections with
headings different from those described in this manual. See Section 2.26 for more on organization.

Format. The text should start on a new page after the title page and abstract (if the paper includes an abstract). On the first line
of the first page of the text, write the title of the paper in title case, bold, and centered. The text should be left-aligned, double-
spaced paragraphs, with the first line of each paragraph indented by one tab key (0.5 in.; see Sections 2.23 –2.24). Use headings
as  needed  and  appropriate  within  the  text  to  separate  sections  and  to  reflect  the  organizational  structure  of  the  content  (see
Sections 2.26 –2.27). Do not start a new page or add extra line breaks when a new heading occurs; each section of the text should
follow the next without a break.

2.12 Reference List
The  reference  list  provides  a  reliable  way  for  readers  to  locate  the  works  authors  cite  to  acknowledge  previous  scholarship.
References  are  used  to  document  and  substantiate  statements  made  about  the  literature,  just  as  data  in  the  paper  are  used  to
support interpretations and conclusions. The references cited in the paper do not need to be exhaustive but should be sufficient to

52

support  the  need  for  your  research  and  to  enable  readers  to  place  it  in  the  context  of  previous  research  and  theorizing.  For
detailed guidance on citing sources in the text and preparing the reference list, consult Chapters 8 and 9, respectively.

Format.  Start  the  reference  list  on  a  new  page  after  the  text  and  before  any  tables,  figures,  and/or  appendices.  Label  the
reference  list  “References,”  capitalized,  in  bold,  and  centered.  Double-space  all  reference  list  entries  (including  between  and
within  references).  Use  a  hanging  indent  for  all  references,  meaning  that  the  first  line  of  each  reference  is  flush  left  and
subsequent  lines  are  indented  by  0.5  in.  Use  the  paragraph-formatting  function  of  your  word-processing  program  to
automatically apply the hanging indent. For the order of works in the reference list, see Sections 9.44 to 9.49.

2.13 Footnotes
A footnote is a brief note that provides additional content or copyright attribution. Any type of paper may include footnotes.

Content  Footnotes.  Content  footnotes  supplement  or  enhance  substantive  information  in  the  text;  they  should  not  include
complicated,  irrelevant,  or  nonessential  information.  Because  they  can  be  distracting  to  readers,  content  footnotes  should  be
included  only  if  they  strengthen  the  discussion.  A  content  footnote  should  convey  just  one  idea;  if  you  find  yourself  creating
paragraphs  or  displaying  equations  as  you  are  writing  a  footnote,  then  the  main  text  or  an  appendix  would  likely  be  a  more
suitable  place  to  present  the  information.  Another  alternative  is  to  indicate  in  a  short  footnote  that  supplemental  material  is
available  online  (see  Section  2.15).  In  most  cases,  authors  integrate  an  idea  into  an  article  best  by  presenting  important
information in the text, not in a footnote.

Copyright Attribution. When authors reproduce lengthy quotations and/or test or scale items in the text, a copyright attribution
is usually required and should be presented in a footnote. A reproduced table or figure also requires a copyright attribution, but
this  attribution  appears  in  the  table  or  figure  note.  Further  directions  on  seeking  permission  to  reproduce  material  and
appropriate wording for the copyright attribution appear in Sections 12.14 to 12.18.

Footnote Callout Numbering and Format. Number all footnotes consecutively in the order in which their callouts appear in
the text with superscript Arabic numerals. Footnote callouts should be superscripted, like this,1 following any punctuation mark
except  a  dash.  A  footnote  callout  that  appears  with  a  dash —like  this2 —always  precedes  the  dash.  (The  callout  falls  inside  a
closing parenthesis if it applies only to matter within the parentheses, like this.3) Do not put a space before the footnote callout
in text. Do not place footnote callouts in headings. To refer to a footnote again after it has been called out, identify it in the text
by the footnote number (e.g., write “see Footnote 3”); do not repeat the footnote callout or the whole footnote.

Place each footnote at the bottom of the page on which it is discussed using the footnote function of your word-processing
program (see the sample professional paper at the end of this chapter for examples). Footnotes may alternatively be placed in
consecutive order on a separate page after the references; in this case, put the section label “Footnotes” in bold, centered at the
top of the page; then write the footnotes themselves as double-spaced indented paragraphs that begin with a superscript footnote
number, and put a space between the footnote number and the text that follows. Be sure that the number of the footnote callout
corresponds with the number that appears with the footnoted text.

2.14 Appendices
Sometimes authors wish to include material that supplements the paper’s content but that would be distracting or inappropriate
in the text of the paper. Such material can often be included in an appendix, which is included in the print and electronic versions
of the article, or in supplemental materials (see Section 2.15), which are available in an online-only supplemental archive that
the publisher maintains.

Include an appendix only if it helps readers understand, evaluate, or replicate the study or theoretical argument being made.
Be  sure  that  all  relevant  ethical  standards  have  been  followed  for  materials  placed  in  the  appendices,  including  copyright
attribution, accurate representation of data, and protection of human participants (e.g., as the standards apply to images or videos
of identifiable people; see Sections 1.18 and 12.17).

In  general,  an  appendix  is  appropriate  for  materials  that  are  relatively  brief  and  easily  presented  in  print  format.  Some
examples of material suitable for an appendix are (a) lists of stimulus materials (e.g., those used in psycholinguistic research);
(b) instructions to participants; (c) tests, scales, or inventories developed for the study being reported; (d) detailed descriptions of
complex  equipment;  (e)  detailed  demographic  descriptions  of  subpopulations  in  the  study;  and  (f)  other  detailed  or  complex
reporting items described in Chapter 3. Student papers may include appendices.

53

Format. Begin each appendix on a separate page after any references, footnotes, tables, and figures. Give each appendix a label
and a title. If a paper has one appendix, label it “Appendix”; if a paper has more than one appendix, label each appendix with a
capital  letter  (e.g.,  “Appendix  A,”  “Appendix  B”)  in  the  order  in  which  it  is  mentioned  in  the  text.  Each  appendix  should  be
mentioned  (called  out)  at  least  once  in  the  text  by  its  label  (e.g.,  “see  Appendix  A”).  The  appendix  title  should  describe  its
contents. Place the appendix label and title in bold and centered on separate lines at the top of the page on which the appendix
begins. Use title case (see Section 6.17) for the appendix label and title.

The  appendix  may  consist  of  text,  tables,  figures,  or  a  combination  of  these.  A  text  appendix  may  contain  headings  and
displayed equations. If an appendix contains text, write the paragraphs as regular indented paragraphs the same as in the body of
the paper. If a text appendix contains tables, figures, footnotes, and/or displayed equations, give each one a number preceded by
the letter of the appendix in which it appears (e.g., Table A1 is the first table within Appendix A or of a sole appendix that is not
labeled with a letter; Equation B1 is the first equation within Appendix B; Figure C2 is the second figure of Appendix C). In a
sole text appendix, which is not labeled with a letter, precede all table, figure, footnote, and equation numbers with the letter “A”
to distinguish them from those of the main text. All tables and figures within a text appendix must be mentioned in the appendix
and  numbered  in  order  of  mention.  The  tables  and  figures  within  a  text  appendix  should  be  embedded  within  the  text,  as
described in Section 7.6.

If an appendix consists of a table only or a figure only, then the appendix label takes the place of the table or figure number,
and  the  appendix  title  takes  the  place  of  the  table  or  figure  title.  Thus,  if  Appendix  B  is  a  table-only  appendix,  the  table  is
referred to as Appendix B rather than as Table B1. Likewise, if Appendix C is a figure-only appendix, the figure is referred to as
Appendix C rather than as Figure C1. If multiple tables and/or figures (but no text) are combined into one appendix, label and
title the appendix and also number and title the tables and/or figures within the appendix (e.g., Tables D1 and D2 are two tables
in Appendix D).

2.15 Supplemental Materials
Supplemental  materials  to  a  journal  article  are  published  online  only.  These  materials  enrich  readers’  experience  and
understanding  of  the  content  of  the  article.  Online-only  publication  tends  to  be  appropriate  for  materials  that  are  more  useful
when  available  as  downloadable  files  and  for  materials  that  are  not  easily  presented  in  print.  Student  papers  do  not  typically
include supplemental materials.

Some examples of content provided as supplemental materials are

video clips, audio clips, or animations
lengthy computer code
details of mathematical or computational models
oversized tables
detailed intervention protocols
expanded methodology descriptions
color figures or other images (see Section 7.26)
printable templates and worksheets
data files (e.g., generated using SPSS or other software)

Supplemental  materials  should  include  enough  information  to  make  their  content  interpretable  when  accompanied  by  the
published text. Also keep in mind accessibility guidelines as they pertain to online or interactive materials to ensure that your
files are not only openable but also accessible to all readers.1 Complete data sets should be made available, as appropriate, in
online repositories or archives (see Section 10.9 for the reference format) or in supplemental materials. See Sections 1.14  and
1.15 for more on data retention and sharing.

Because  this  content  may  be  useful  to  the  field,  APA  and  many  other  publishers  make  it  possible  to  provide  supplemental
materials to a wide audience by posting them online and placing a link with the published article. These files (like appendices)
then become part of the primary journal record and cannot be augmented, altered, or deleted. As such, materials for inclusion in
supplemental  materials  should  be  submitted  in  formats  that  are  widely  accessible.  We  recommend  checking  with  the  journal
publisher for preferred file types and any limitations.

Less widely used file formats, including TeX, LaTeX, any client- or server-side scripting (e.g., Java, CGI), executable files,
and  software  applications,  might  be  acceptable  but  of  less  use  to  readers  who  do  not  have  access  to  specialized  programs.
Because  of  the  risk  of  downloading  embedded  viruses  or  malware,  many  uncommon  file  types  or  executable  files  may  be
blocked by firewalls and antivirus protection programs, system administrators, or users. Therefore, we do not recommend using

54

such file types unless they are critical to understanding or using your material (e.g., syntax from a methodological paper such as
an SPSS macro might be saved with an SPS extension so that it can be used directly by other researchers). Briefly describe any
supplemental materials in the text or a footnote to the text as appropriate (see Section 2.13).

Most  journals  make  supplemental  materials  subject  to  peer  review  and  require  that  they  be  submitted  with  the  initial
manuscript. Once accepted, the supplemental materials are typically posted with no editing, formatting, or typesetting. For APA
journals, a link to the supplemental materials appears in the published article and leads readers to a landing page that includes a
bibliographic citation, a link to the published article, and a context statement and link for each supplemental file (see an example
of  a  landing  page  at  https://on.apa.org/2CmDGd6).  Other  journals  may  include  links  in  the  article  that  directly  open  the
supplemental  files.  See  Chapter  3  for  more  details  on  the  role  of  supplemental  materials  in  JARS.  See  the  APA  website
(https://on.apa.org/2Qo7OhX) for additional information about supplemental materials.

Format

2.16 Importance of Format

Use the guidelines in this section to format all APA Style papers. The physical appearance of a paper can enhance or detract
from  it.  A  well-prepared  paper  encourages  editors  and  reviewers,  as  well  as  instructors  in  the  case  of  student  work,  to  view
authors’ work as professional. In contrast, mechanical flaws can lead reviewers or instructors to misinterpret content or question
the  authors’  expertise  or  attention  to  detail,  and  students  may  receive  a  lower  grade  because  of  formatting  errors.  For
manuscripts being submitted for publication, publishers will use your word-processing file to produce the typeset version of your
article, so it is important that you properly format your article.

2.17 Order of Pages
Arrange the pages of the paper in the following order:

title page (page 1)
abstract (start on a new page after the title page)
text (start on a new page after the abstract, or after the title page if the paper does not have an abstract)
references (start on a new page after the end of the text)
footnotes (start on a new page after the references)
tables (start each on a new page after the footnotes)
figures (start each on a new page after the tables)
appendices (start each on a new page after the tables and/or figures)

APA Style provides options for the display of footnotes, tables, and figures. Footnotes may appear either in the footer of the page
where they are first mentioned (see Section 2.13) or on a separate page after the references. Tables and figures may be embedded
within the text after they have been mentioned, or each table and figure can be displayed on a separate page after the footnotes
(or after the references if there is no footnotes page; see Section 7.6).

2.18 Page Header
All papers should contain the page number, flush right, in the header of every page. Use the automatic page-numbering function
of your word-processing pro-gram to insert page numbers in the top right corner; do not type page numbers manually. The title
page is page number 1.

Manuscripts being submitted for publication should contain the running head (see Section 2.8) in the page header in addition
to  the  page  number.  When  both  elements  appear,  the  running  head  should  be  flush  left  and  the  page  number  should  be  flush
right. Student papers need only the page number in the page header, unless the instructor or institution also requires a running
head.

2.19 Font
APA Style papers should be written in a font that is accessible to all users. Historically, sans serif fonts have been preferred for
online works and serif fonts for print works; however, modern screen resolutions can typically accommodate either type of font,

55

and  people  who  use  assistive  technologies  can  adjust  font  settings  to  their  preferences.  Thus,  a  variety  of  font  choices  are
permitted in APA Style; also check with your publisher, instructor, or institution for any requirements regarding font.

Use the same font throughout the text of the paper. Options include

a sans serif font such as 11-point Calibri, 11-point Arial, or 10-point Lucida Sans Unicode or

a serif font such as 12-point Times New Roman, 11-point Georgia, or normal (10-point) Computer Modern (the latter is the
default font for LaTeX).

We recommend these fonts because they are legible and widely available and because they include special characters such as
math symbols and Greek letters.

An APA Style paper may contain other fonts or font sizes under the following circumstances:

Within figure images, use a sans serif font with a type size between 8 and 14 points.

When presenting computer code, use a monospace font, such as 10-point Lucida Console or 10-point Courier New.

When presenting a footnote in a page footer, the default footnote settings of your word-processing program are acceptable
(e.g., 10-point font with single line spacing).

Because different fonts take up different amounts of space on the page, we recommend using word count rather than page count
to gauge paper length (see Section 2.25). See the APA Style website (https://apastyle.apa.org) for further discussion of font and
accessible typography.

2.20 Special Characters
Special  characters  are  accented  letters  and  other  diacritical  marks,  Greek  letters,  math  signs,  and  symbols.  Type  special
characters using the special character functions of your word-processing program or a plug-in such as MathType. Characters that
are not available should be presented as images. For more information on Greek letters and mathematical symbols, see Sections
6.44 and 6.45.

2.21 Line Spacing
Double-space the entire paper, including the title page, abstract, text, headings, block quotations, reference list, table and figure
notes, and appendices, with the following exceptions:

title page: Elements of the title page are double-spaced, and an additional double-spaced blank line appears between the title
and byline. At least one double-spaced blank line also appears between the final affiliation and any author note (see Figure
2.1).

table body and figure image: The table body (cells) and words within the image part of a figure may be single-spaced, one-
and-a-half-spaced,  or  double-spaced,  depending  on  what  format  creates  the  most  effective  presentation  of  the  data.  If  text
appears on the same page as a table or figure, insert a double-spaced blank line between the text and the table or figure (for
more information on placement of tables and figures, see Section 7.6).

footnotes:  Footnotes  that  appear  at  the  bottom  of  the  page  on  which  they  are  called  out  should  be  single-spaced  and
formatted  with  the  default  settings  of  your  word-processing  program.  Footnotes  that  appear  on  their  own  page  after  the
references should be formatted like regular paragraphs of text —that is, indented and double-spaced.

displayed equations: It is permissible to apply triple- or quadruple-spacing in special circumstances, such as before and after
a displayed equation.

It  is  not  necessary  to  add  blank  lines  before  or  after  headings,  even  if  a  heading  falls  at  the  end  of  a  page.  Do  not  add  extra
spacing between paragraphs.

2.22 Margins
Use 1-in. (2.54-cm) margins on all sides (top, bottom, left, and right) of the page. This is the default page margin in most word-
processing  programs.  Dissertations  and  theses  may  have  different  requirements  if  they  are  to  be  bound  (e.g.,  1.5-in.  left
margins).

2.23 Paragraph Alignment

56

Align the text to the left and leave the right margin uneven (“ragged”). Do not use full justification, which adjusts the spacing
between words to make all lines the same length (flush with the margins). Do not manually divide words at the end of a line, and
do not use the hyphenation function to break words at the ends of lines. Do not manually insert line breaks into long DOIs or
URLs; however, breaks in DOIs or URLs applied automatically by a word-processing program are permissible.

2.24 Paragraph Indentation
Indent the first line of every paragraph 0.5 in. For consistency, use the tab key or the automatic paragraph-formatting function of
your word-processing program. The default settings in most word-processing programs are acceptable. The remaining lines of
the paragraph should be left-aligned.

Exceptions to these paragraph indentation requirements are as follows:

For professional papers, the title (in bold), byline, and affiliations on the title page should be centered (see Figure 2.1).

For student papers, the title (in bold), byline, affiliations, course number and name, instructor, and assignment date should be
centered (see Figure 2.2).

Section labels should be centered (and bold; see Section 2.28).

The first line of the abstract should be flush left (not indented; see Section 2.9).

The entirety of a block quotation should be indented from the left margin 0.5 in. If the block quotation spans more than one
paragraph, the first line of the second and any subsequent paragraphs of the block quotation should be indented another 0.5
in., such that those first lines are indented a total of 1 in. (see Section 8.27).

Level 1 headings should be centered (and in bold), and Level 2 and 3 headings should be left-aligned (and in bold or bold
italic, respectively; see Section 2.27).

Table and figure numbers (Sections 7.10 and 7.24, respectively), titles (Sections 7.11 and 7.25), and notes (Sections 7.14 and
7.28) should be flush left.

Reference list entries should have a hanging indent of 0.5 in. (see Section 2.12).

Appendix labels and titles should be centered (and bold; see Section 2.14).

2.25 Paper Length
Journals  differ  in  the  average  length  of  articles  they  publish;  consult  the  journal’s  instructions  for  authors  to  determine  the
appropriate  length  for  the  type  of  article  you  are  submitting.  The  length  for  student  papers  is  determined  by  the  assignment
guidelines.

If  a  paper  exceeds  the  target  length,  shorten  it  by  stating  points  clearly  and  directly,  confining  discussion  to  the  specific
problem under investigation, deleting or combining data displays, eliminating repetition across sections, and writing in the active
voice. For guidance on improving sentence and paragraph length, see Section 4.6. A professional paper that is still too long may
need  to  be  divided  into  two  or  more  papers,  each  with  a  more  specific  focus  (however,  see  Section  1.16  on  piecemeal
publication).

Paper length targets may be specified by either page count or word count; we recommend word count because different fonts
are slightly different sizes and may produce variations in the number of pages. In general, to determine the page count, count
every page, including the title page and reference list. Likewise, to determine word count, count every word from beginning to
end,  including  all  in-text  citations,  reference  entries,  tables,  figures  (other  than  words  in  a  figure  image,  which  may  not  be
captured by word count), and appendices. The default settings of the word-count function of your word-processing program are
acceptable  for  determining  the  word  count.  Do  not  count  text  in  the  page  header  (i.e.,  running  head  and/or  page  numbers)  or
manually add any words within figure images to the word count (these words are generally not included in the automatic word
count in programs such as Microsoft Word, Academic Writer, or Google Docs). If the journal to which you are submitting has
different specifications for determining the page count or word count, follow the instructions of the journal.

Organization

2.26 Principles of Organization

57

In scholarly writing, sound organizational structure is the key to clear, precise, and logical communication. Before beginning to
write,  consider  the  best  paper  length  and  structure  for  your  findings.  Ordering  your  thoughts  logically  at  both  sentence  and
paragraph levels will also strengthen the impact of your writing.

Headings  in  a  document  identify  the  topic  or  purpose  of  the  content  within  each  section.  Headings  help  readers  become
familiar with how a paper’s content is organized, allowing them to easily find the information they seek. Headings should be
succinct  yet  long  enough  to  describe  the  content;  see  the  sample  papers  at  the  end  of  this  chapter  for  examples  of  effective
headings. Concise headings help readers anticipate key points and track the development of your argument. Headings that are
well formatted and clearly worded aid both visual and nonvisual readers of all abilities. Headings must be clearly distinguishable
from the text. For a deeper discussion of how to effectively create and use headings (and related text) for all users (including
those using assistive technologies), visit the APA Style website (https://apastyle.apa.org).

There are five possible levels of heading in APA Style (see Section 2.27), and all topics of equal importance should have the
same  level  of  heading.  For  example,  in  a  multiexperiment  paper,  the  headings  for  the  Method  and  Results  sections  for
Experiment  1  should  be  the  same  level  as  the  headings  for  the  Method  and  Results  sections  for  Experiment  2,  with  parallel
wording.  In  a  single-experiment  paper,  the  Method,  Results,  and  Discussion  sections  should  all  have  the  same  heading  level.
Avoid having only one subsection heading within a section, just like in an outline; use at least two subsection headings within a
section, or use none (e.g., in an outline, a section numbered with a Roman numeral would be divided into either a minimum of A
and B subsections or no subsections; an A subsection could not stand alone).

2.27 Heading Levels
APA Style headings have five possible levels: Level 1 headings are used for top-level or main sections, Level 2 headings are
subsections of Level 1, and so on. Regardless of the number of levels of subheading within a section, the heading structure for
all sections follows the same top-down progression. Each section starts with the highest level of heading, even if one section has
fewer  levels  of  subheading  than  another  section.  For  example,  in  a  paper  with  Level  1  Method,  Results,  and  Discussion
headings, the Method and Results sections may each have two levels of subheading (Levels 2 and 3), and the Discussion section
may have only one level of subheading (Level 2). Thus, there would be three levels of heading for the paper overall.

Headings  in  the  Introduction.  Because  the  first  paragraphs  of  a  paper  are  understood  to  be  introductory,  the  heading
“Introduction” is not needed. Do not begin a paper with an “Introduction” heading; the paper title at the top of the first page of
text acts as a de facto Level 1 heading (see Figure 2.4). For subsections within the introduction, use Level 2 headings for the first
level of subsection, Level 3 for subsections of any Level 2 headings, and so on. After the introduction (regardless of whether it
includes headings), use a Level 1 heading for the next main section of the paper (e.g., Method).

58

Figure 2.4 Use of Headings in a Sample Introduction

Full Description.

Number of Headings in a Paper. The number of levels of heading needed for a paper depends on its length and complexity;
three is average. If only one level of heading is needed, use Level 1; if two levels are needed, use Levels 1 and 2; if three levels
are needed, use Levels 1, 2, and 3; and so forth. Use only the number of headings necessary to differentiate distinct sections in
your paper; short student papers may not require any headings. Do not label headings with numbers or letters.2

Format. Table 2.3 shows how to format each level of heading, Figure 2.4 demonstrates the use of headings in the introduction,
and Figure 2.5 lists all the headings used in a sample paper in correct format. The sample papers at the end of this chapter also
show the use of headings in context.

J OU R N A L A R TIC LE R EPOR TIN G STA N D A R D S

This  chapter  orients  readers  to  a  specialized  set  of  guidelines  developed  by  APA  referred  to  as  journal  article  reporting
standards,  or  JARS.  These  standards  provide  guidelines  for  authors  on  what  information  should  be  included,  at  minimum,  in
journal  articles.  By  using  JARS,  authors  can  make  their  research  clearer,  more  accurate,  and  more  transparent  for  readers.
Writing clearly and reporting research in a way that is easier to comprehend helps ensure scientific rigor and methodological
integrity and improves the quality of published research. Reporting standards are closely related to the way studies are designed
and conducted, but they do not prescribe how to design or execute studies, and they are not dependent on the topic of the study
or the particular journal in which the study might be published. Comprehensive, uniform reporting standards make it easier to
compare research, to understand the implications of individual studies, and to allow techniques of meta-analysis to proceed more
efficiently.  Decision  makers  in  policy  and  practice  have  also  emphasized  the  importance  of  understanding  how  research  was
conducted and what was found.

This  chapter  contains  practical  guidance  for  authors  who  will  use  JARS  when  reporting  their  research—primarily,  authors
seeking  professional  publication  as  well  as  undergraduate  or  graduate  students  conducting  advanced  research  projects.
Undergraduate  students  who  are  writing  less  complicated  research  papers  may  also  find  the  standards  on  the  abstract  and
introduction helpful (see Sections 3.3–3.4). Note that the information available regarding JARS is substantial and detailed; this
chapter is only an introduction. The APA Style JARS website (https://apastyle.apa.org/jars) contains a wealth of resources (links
to many appear throughout this chapter). JARS may also be revised and expanded in the future as new standards are developed;
any such changes will be reflected on the website. The sections that follow discuss the application of the principles of JARS,
including why the standards exist and how they have evolved; terminology used to discuss JARS, with a link to a glossary on the
JARS  website;  reporting  standards  for  abstracts  and  introductions  that  pertain  to  all  types  of  research  articles;  and  specific
standards for quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods research.

Overview of Reporting Standards

3.1 Application of the Principles of JARS

By adopting and following JARS in their articles, researchers

help readers fully understand the research being reported and draw valid conclusions from the work,

allow reviewers and editors to properly evaluate manuscripts submitted for publication for their scientific value,

enable future researchers to replicate the research reported,

transparency

foster
https://apastyle.apa.org/jars/transparency), and

(for  more  on

the

ethic  of

transparency

in

JARS,

see

the

JARS  website

at

improve the quality of published research.

Within these guidelines for reporting standards, however, is flexibility in how the standards are applied across different types of
research studies. Guidelines on where to include information recommended in JARS within an article are flexible in most cases
(exceptions are information that must appear in the title page, abstract, or author note; see Tables 3.1–3.3 later in this chapter). In
general, any information that is necessary to comprehend and interpret the study should be in the text of the journal article, and

96

information that might be needed for replication can be included in supplemental materials available online with few barriers to
readers.  Authors  should  consult  with  journal  editors  to  resolve  questions  regarding  what  information  to  include  and  where,
keeping readability of the article as a prime consideration. Reviewers and editors are encouraged to learn to recognize whether
reporting standards have been met regardless of the rhetorical style of the research presentation.

Reporting standards are evolving to reflect the needs of the research community. The original JARS, published in American
Psychologist (APA Publications and Communications Board Working Group on Journal Article Reporting Standards, 2008) as
well as in the sixth edition of the Publication Manual (APA, 2010), addressed only quantitative research. The updated JARS,
published in 2018 (see Appelbaum et al., 2018; Levitt et al., 2018), expands on the types of quantitative research (JARS–Quant)
addressed and now includes standards for reporting qualitative (JARS–Qual) and mixed methods (JARS–Mixed) research. As
research approaches continue to evolve, authors should use these standards to support the publication of research; they should
not allow these standards to restrict the development of new methods.

3.2 Terminology Used in JARS
Researchers  use  many  methods  and  strategies  to  meet  their  research  goals,  and  the  guidelines  in  JARS  were  developed  to
facilitate  the  reporting  of  research  across  a  range  of  research  traditions  (Appelbaum  et  al.,  2018;  Levitt  et  al.,  2018).  These
methods  fall  into  either  quantitative  (Sections  1.1  and  3.5–3.8),  qualitative  (Sections  1.2  and  3.13–3.16),  or  mixed  methods
(Sections 1.3 and 3.18) traditions; separate reporting standards exist for each tradition. There are also specialized standards for
particular quantitative (see Sections 3.9–3.12) and qualitative methodologies (see Section 3.17), such as meta-analysis.

Given  this  diversity,  the  terms  used  in  this  chapter  may  be  unfamiliar  to  some  readers.  See  the  JARS  website
(https://apastyle.apa.org/jars/glossary)  for  a  glossary  of  related  terms,  including  “approaches  to  inquiry,”  “data-analytic
strategies,”  “data-collection  strategies,”  “methodological  integrity,”  “research  design,”  and  “trustworthiness.”  Because
researchers  do  not  always  agree  on  terminology,  we  encourage  authors  to  translate  these  terms  to  reflect  their  own  preferred
approaches, taking care to define terms for readers. We recognize that our language inevitably carries philosophical implications
(e.g., do researchers “discover,” “understand,” or “co-construct” findings?). We also encourage reviewers and editors to view our
terms as placeholders that may be usefully varied by authors to reflect the values of their research traditions.

Common Reporting Standards Across Research Designs

Many aspects of the scientific process are common across quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods approaches. This section
reviews reporting standards that have considerable overlap for the two initial elements of journal articles—the abstract and the
introduction. We present the common reporting standards for the abstract and introduction as well as some distinctive features
for  each  approach.  For  descriptions  of  and  formatting  guidelines  for  the  title,  byline  and  institutional  affiliation,  author  note,
running head, abstract, keywords, text (the body of a paper), reference list, footnotes, appendices, and supplemental materials,
see Chapter 2 (Sections 2.4–2.15).

3.3 Abstract Standards
An abstract is a brief, comprehensive summary of the contents of the paper. A well-prepared abstract can be the most important
paragraph  in  an  article.  Many  people  have  their  first  contact  with  an  article  by  reading  the  title  and  abstract,  usually  in
comparison  with  several  others,  as  they  conduct  a  literature  search.  Readers  frequently  decide  on  the  basis  of  the  abstract
whether  to  read  the  entire  article.  The  abstract  needs  to  be  dense  with  information.  By  embedding  essential  terms  in  your
abstract, you enhance readers’ ability to find the article. This section addresses the qualities of a good abstract and standards for
what to include in abstracts for different paper types (see Sections 1.1–1.10). Requirements for abstract length and instructions
on formatting the abstract are presented in Section 2.9.

Qualities of a Good Abstract. A good abstract is

accurate: Ensure  that  the  abstract  correctly  reflects  the  purpose  and  content  of  the  paper.  Do  not  include  information  that
does not appear in the paper body. If the study extends or replicates previous research, cite the relevant work with an author–
date citation.

nonevaluative: Report rather than evaluate; do not add to or comment on what is in the body of the paper.

97

coherent and readable: Write in clear and deliberate language. Use verbs rather than their noun equivalents and the active
rather than the passive voice (e.g., “investigated” instead of “an investigation of”; “we present results” instead of “results are
presented”; see Section 4.13). Use the present tense to describe conclusions drawn or results with continuing applicability;
use the past tense to describe specific variables manipulated or outcomes measured. If presenting statistical or mathematical
information, see Sections 6.40 to 6.48 for the appropriate formats.

concise: Be brief, and make each sentence maximally informative, especially the lead sentence. Begin the abstract with the
most  important  points.  Do  not  waste  space  by  repeating  the  title.  Include  only  the  four  or  five  most  important  concepts,
findings, or implications. Use the specific words in your abstract that you think your audience will use in their searches.

Empirical  Articles.  The  abstract  for  an  empirical  article  (quantitative,  qualitative,  or  mixed  methods;  see  Sections  1.1–1.3)
should describe the following:

the  problem  under  investigation,  in  one  sentence,  if  possible;  when  presenting  quantitative  analyses,  include  the  main
hypotheses, questions, or theories under investigation

participants or data sources, specifying pertinent characteristics (e.g., for nonhuman animal research, include the genus and
species); participants will be described in greater detail in the body of the paper

essential features of the study method, including

research design (e.g., experimental, observational, qualitative, mixed methods)
analytic strategy (e.g., ethnography, factor analysis)
data-gathering procedures
sample  size  (typically  for  quantitative  analyses)  or  description  of  the  volume  of  observations  or  number  of  participants
(typically for qualitative analyses)
materials or central measures used
a statement about whether the study is a secondary data analysis

basic findings, including

for quantitative analyses, effect sizes and confidence intervals in addition to statistical significance levels when possible
for qualitative methods, main findings in relation to central contextual features

conclusions and implications or applications of the research findings

Replication Articles. The abstract for a replication article (see Section 1.4) should describe the following:

type of replication being reported (e.g., direct [exact, literal], approximate, conceptual [construct])

scope of the replication in detail

original study or studies that are being replicated

general conclusions reached in the replication

Quantitative  or  Qualitative  Meta-Analyses.  The  abstract  for  a  quantitative  or  qualitative  meta-analysis  (see  Section  1.5)
should describe the following:

research problems, questions, or hypotheses under investigation

characteristics for the inclusion of studies, including

for quantitative meta-analyses, independent variables, dependent variables, and eligible study designs
for qualitative meta-analyses, criteria for eligibility in terms of study topic and research design

methods  of  synthesis,  including  statistical  or  qualitative  metamethods  used  to  summarize  or  compare  studies  and  specific
methods used to integrate studies

main results, including

for  all  studies,  the  number  of  studies;  the  number  of  participants,  observations,  or  data  sources;  and  their  important
characteristics
for quantitative analyses, the most important effect sizes and any important moderators of these effect sizes
for qualitative analyses, the most important findings in their context

conclusions (including limitations)

98

implications for theory, policy, and/or practice

Literature  Review  Articles.  The  abstract  for  a  literature  review  article  (also  called  a  narrative  literature  review  article;  see
Section 1.6) should describe the substantive content being reviewed, including the following:

scope of the literature examined in the review (e.g., journals, books, unpublished abstracts) and the number of items included
in the review

period of time covered in the review (e.g., range of years)

general conclusions reached in the review

Theoretical Articles. The abstract for a theoretical article (see Section 1.7) should describe the following:

how the theory or model works and/or the principles on which it is based

what phenomena the theory or model accounts for and linkages to empirical results

Methodological Articles. The abstract for a methodological article (see Section 1.8) should describe the following:

general class, essential features, and range of applications of the methods, methodologies, or epistemological beliefs being
discussed

essential features of the approaches being reported, such as robustness or power efficiency in the case of statistical procedures
or methodological integrity and trustworthiness in the case of qualitative methods

3.4 Introduction Standards
The  body  of  a  paper  always  opens  with  an  introduction.  The  introduction contains  a  succinct  description  of  the  issues  being
reported, their historical antecedents, and the study objectives.

Frame the Importance of the Problem. The introduction of an article frames the issues being studied. Consider the various
concerns on which your issue touches and its effects on other outcomes (e.g., the effects of shared storybook reading on word
learning  in  children).  This  framing  may  be  in  terms  of  fundamental  psychological  theory,  potential  application  including
therapeutic uses, input for public policy, and so forth. Proper framing helps set readers’ expectations for what the report will and
will not include.

Historical  Antecedents.  Review  the  literature  succinctly  to  convey  to  readers  the  scope  of  the  problem,  its  context,  and  its
theoretical or practical implications. Clarify which elements of your paper have been subject to prior investigation and how your
work  differs  from  earlier  reports.  In  this  process,  describe  any  key  issues,  debates,  and  theoretical  frameworks  and  clarify
barriers, knowledge gaps, or practical needs. Including these descriptions will show how your work builds usefully on what has
already been accomplished in the field.

Articulate Study Goals. Clearly state and delimit the aims, objectives, and/or goals of your study. Make explicit the rationale
for the fit of your design in relation to your aims and goals. Describe the goals in a way that clarifies the appropriateness of the
methods you used.

Quantitative Goals. In a quantitative article, the introduction should identify the primary and secondary hypotheses as well as
any  exploratory  hypotheses,  specifying  how  the  hypotheses  derive  from  ideas  discussed  in  previous  research  and  whether
exploratory hypotheses were derived as a result of planned or unplanned analyses.

Qualitative Goals. In a qualitative article, the introduction may contain case examples, personal narratives, vignettes, or other
illustrative materials. It should describe your research goal(s) and approach to inquiry. Examples of qualitative research goals
include developing theory, hypotheses, and deep understandings (e.g., Hill, 2012; Stiles, 1993); examining the development of a
social construct (e.g., Neimeyer et al., 2008); addressing societal injustices (e.g., Fine, 2013); and illuminating social discursive
practices—that is, the way interpersonal and public communications are enacted (e.g., Parker, 2015). The term approaches to
inquiry  refers  to  the  philosophical  assumptions  that  underlie  research  traditions  or  strategies—for  example,  the  researchers’
epistemological  beliefs,  worldview,  paradigm,  strategies,  or  research  traditions  (Creswell  &  Poth,  2018;  Morrow,  2005;
Ponterotto,  2005).  For  instance,  you  might  indicate  that  your  approach  or  approaches  to  inquiry  are  constructivist,  critical,
descriptive,  feminist,  interpretive,  postmodern,  postpositivist,  pragmatic,  or  psychoanalytic.  Note  that  researchers  may  define

99

these philosophies differently, and some qualitative research is more question driven and pragmatic than theoretical. You might
also address your approach to inquiry in the Method section (see Section 3.14).

Mixed Methods Goals. In a mixed methods or multimethod article, the introduction should describe the objectives for all study
components  presented,  the  rationale  for  their  being  presented  in  one  study,  and  the  rationale  for  the  order  in  which  they  are
presented within the paper (see Section 3.18). In all cases, clarify how the questions or hypotheses under examination led to the
research design to meet the study aims.

Goals  for  Other  Types  of  Papers.  Introductions  for  other  types  of  papers  follow  similar  principles  and  articulate  the  specific
motivation  for  the  study.  For  instance,  a  replication  study  conducted  as  a  quantitative  study  would  have  an  introduction  that
follows the principles for the introduction of a quantitative study but that emphasizes the need to replicate a certain study or set
of studies as well as the methods used to accomplish the desired replication.

Reporting Standards for Quantitative Research

3.5 Basic Expectations for Quantitative Research Reporting

Whereas standards for reporting information in the abstract and introduction of a paper are common to all kinds of research (see
Sections 3.3–3.4),  there  are  specific  reporting  standards  for  quantitative  research  articles,  including  the  Method,  Results,  and
Discussion sections (see Sections 3.6–3.8). Note that this is a conceptual separation, but in practice, the information specified in
these  three  sets  of  reporting  standards  may  be  intermixed  in  several  sections  of  the  paper  to  optimize  readability.  Standards
specific to qualitative and mixed methods research are presented in Sections 3.13 to 3.17 and 3.18, respectively.

The basic expectations for reporting quantitative research are presented in Table 3.1.1 This table describes minimal reporting
standards that apply to all quantitative-based inquires. Additional tables describe other reporting features that are added because
of  particular  design  features  or  empirical  claims.  Consult  Figure  3.1  to  determine  which  tables  to  use  for  your  quantitative
research  and  for  links  to  all  tables  on  the  JARS  website  (because  this  chapter  is  an  orientation  to  JARS,  only  the  main
quantitative table is presented here). Every empirical study must include features from Table 3.1 plus features from at least one
additional table. The content of Table 3.1 by itself is not sufficient as a description of reporting standards for quantitative studies.
See Sections 3.9 to 3.12 for descriptions of each additional table.

Figure 3.1 Flowchart of Quantitative Reporting Standards to Follow Depending on Research Design

Note. JARS–Quant = quantitative journal article reporting standards. For more information, see the APA Style JARS website (https://apastyle.apa.org/jars).

3.6 Quantitative Method Standards
The Method section of a paper provides most of the information that readers need to fully comprehend what was done in the
execution of an empirical study. This section provides information that allows readers to understand the research being reported
and that is essential for replication of the study, although the concept of replication may depend on the nature of the study. The
basic information needed to understand the results should (as a rule) appear in the main article, whereas other methodological
information (e.g., detailed descriptions of procedures) may appear in supplemental materials. Readability of the resulting paper
must  be  part  of  the  decision  about  where  material  is  ultimately  located.  Details  of  what  content  needs  to  be  presented  in  the
Method section of a quantitative article are presented in Table 3.1 and must be used in conjunction with JARS–Quant Tables 2 to
9 on the JARS website (https://apastyle.apa.org/jars/quantitative).

Participant (Subject) Characteristics. Appropriate identification of research participants is critical to the science and practice
of  psychology,  particularly  for  generalizing  the  findings,  making  comparisons  across  replications,  and  using  the  evidence  in
research syntheses and secondary data analyses.

105

Detail the major demographic characteristics of the sample, such as age; sex; ethnic and/or racial group; level of education;
socioeconomic, generational, or immigrant status; disability status; sexual orientation; gender identity; and language preference,
as  well  as  important  topic-specific  characteristics  (e.g.,  achievement  level  in  studies  of  educational  interventions).  As  a  rule,
describe the groups as specifically as possible, emphasizing characteristics that may have bearing on the interpretation of results.
Participant characteristics can be important for understanding the nature of the sample and the degree to which results can be
generalized. For example, the following is a useful characterization of a sample:

The second group included 40 cisgender women between the ages of 20 and 30 years (M = 24.2, SD = 2.1, Mdn = 25.1), all of whom
had emigrated from El Salvador; had at least 12 years of education; had been permanent residents of the United States for at least
10 years; and lived in Washington, DC.

To help readers determine how far the data can be generalized, you may find it useful to identify subgroups.

The Asian participants included 30 Chinese and 45 Vietnamese persons.

Among the Latino and Hispanic American men, 20 were Mexican American and 20 were Puerto Rican.

Even when a characteristic is not used in analysis of the data, reporting it may give readers a more complete understanding of
the sample and the generalizability of results and may prove useful in meta-analytic studies that incorporate the article’s results.
The  descriptions  of  participant  characteristics  should  be  sensitive  to  the  ways  the  participants  understand  and  express  their
identities, statuses, histories, and so forth. Chapter 5 contains further guidance on writing without bias.

When nonhuman animal subjects are used, report the genus, species, and strain number or other specific identifier, such as the
name and location of the supplier and the stock designation. Give the number of nonhuman animal subjects and their sex, age,
weight, and physiological condition.

Sampling  Procedures.  Describe  the  procedures  for  selecting  participants,  including  (a)  the  sampling  method,  if  a  systematic
plan  was  implemented;  (b)  the  percentage  of  the  sample  approached  that  participated;  and  (c)  whether  self-selection  into  the
study  occurred  (either  by  individuals  or  by  units  such  as  schools  or  clinics)  and  the  number  of  participants  who  selected
themselves  into  the  sample.  Report  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria,  including  any  restriction  based  on  demographic
characteristics.

Describe the settings and locations in which the data were collected and provide the dates of data collection as a general range
of  dates,  including  dates  for  repeated  measurements  and  follow-ups.  Describe  any  agreements  with  and  payments  made  to
participants. Note institutional review board approvals, data safety board arrangements, and other indications of compliance with
ethical standards.

Sample Size, Power, and Precision.  Provide  the  intended  size  of  the  sample  and  number  of  individuals  meant  to  be  in  each
condition if separate conditions were used. State whether the achieved sample differed in known ways from the intended sample.
Conclusions and interpretations should not go beyond what the achieved sample warrants. State how the intended sample size
was  determined  (e.g.,  analysis  of  power  or  precision).  If  interim  analysis  and  stopping  rules  were  used  to  modify  the  desired
sample size, describe the methodology and results of applying that methodology.

Measures  and  Covariates.  Include  in  the  Method  section  definitions  of  all  primary  and  secondary  outcome  measures  and
covariates,  including  measures  collected  but  not  included  in  the  current  report.  Provide  information  on  instruments  used,
including their psychometric and biometric properties and evidence of cultural validity (Section 3.10 for how to cite hardware
and apparatuses; see Section 10.11 for how to cite tests, scales, and inventories).

Data  Collection.  Describe  the  methods  used  to  collect  data  (e.g.,  written  questionnaires,  interviews,  observations).  Provide
information  on  any  masking  of  participants  in  the  research  (i.e.,  whether  participants,  those  administering  the  manipulations,
and/or those assessing the outcomes were unaware of participants’ assignment to conditions), how masking was accomplished,
and how the masking was assessed. Describe the instrumentation used in the study, including standardized assessments, physical
equipment, and imaging protocols, in sufficient detail to allow exact replication of the study.

Quality of Measurements. Describe methods used to enhance the quality of measurements, including training and reliability of
data collectors, use of multiple observers, translation of research materials, and pretesting of materials on populations who were
not included in the initial development of the instrumentation. Pay attention to the psychometric properties of the measurement
in the context of contemporary testing standards and the sample being investigated; report the psychometric characteristics of the

106

instruments  used  following  the  principles  articulated  in  the  Standards  for  Educational  and  Psychological  Testing  (American
Educational  Research  Association  et  al.,  2014).  In  addition  to  psychometric  characteristics  for  paper-and-pencil  measures,
provide  interrater  reliabilities  for  subjectively  scored  measures  and  ratings.  Internal  consistency  coefficients  can  be  useful  for
understanding composite scales.

Research Design. Specify the research design in the Method section. For example, were participants placed into conditions that
were  manipulated,  or  were  they  observed  in  their  natural  setting?  If  multiple  conditions  were  created,  how  were  participants
assigned  to  conditions—through  random  assignment  or  some  other  selection  mechanism?  Was  the  study  conducted  as  a
between-subjects or a within-subjects design? Reporting standards vary on the basis of the research design (e.g., experimental
manipulation  with  randomization,  clinical  trial  without  randomization,  longitudinal  design).  Consult  Figure  3.1  to  determine
which tables on the JARS website to use for your research design. See Sections 3.9 and 3.10 for a summary of design-specific
reporting  standards.  See  Section  3.11  for  standards  for  particular  analytic  methods  and  Section  3.12  for  quantitative  meta-
analysis standards.

Studies can be mixtures of various types; for instance, a study may involve an experimental manipulation with randomization
with some factors repeated in a longitudinal fashion. For studies not currently covered by JARS, provide the commonly used
name for that design. For more on mixed methods designs, see Section 3.18.

Experimental Manipulations or Interventions. If experimental manipulations or interventions were used in the study, describe
their specific content. Include details of the interventions or manipulations intended for each study condition, including control
groups  (if  any),  and  describe  how  and  when  interventions  or  experimental  manipulations  were  administered.  Describe  the
essential features of “treatment as usual” if that is included as a study or control condition.

Carefully  describe  the  content  of  the  specific  interventions  or  experimental  manipulations  used.  Often,  this  involves
presenting a brief summary of instructions given to participants. If the instructions are unusual, or if the instructions themselves
constitute the experimental manipulation, present them verbatim in an appendix or supplemental materials. If the text is brief,
present it in the body of the paper if it does not interfere with the readability of the report.

Describe the methods of manipulation and data acquisition. If a mechanical apparatus was used to present stimulus materials
or to collect data, include in the description of procedures the apparatus model number and manufacturer (when important, as in
neuroimaging studies), its key settings or parameters (e.g., pulse settings), and its resolution (e.g., stimulus delivery, recording
precision). As with the description of the experimental manipulation or intervention, this material may be presented in the body
of the paper, in an appendix, or in supplemental materials, as appropriate.

When  relevant—such  as  in  the  delivery  of  clinical  and  educational  interventions—the  procedures  should  also  contain  a
description  of  who  delivered  the  intervention,  including  their  level  of  professional  training  and  their  level  of  training  in  the
specific  intervention.  Present  the  number  of  deliverers  along  with  the  mean,  standard  deviation,  and  range  of  number  of
individuals or units treated by each deliverer.

Provide information about (a) the setting in which the manipulation or intervention was delivered, (b) the intended quantity
and duration of exposure to the manipulation or intervention (i.e., how many sessions, episodes, or events were intended to be
delivered and how long they were intended to last), (c) the time span for the delivery of the manipulation or intervention of each
unit (e.g., whether the manipulation delivery was completed in one session, or, if participants returned for multiple sessions, how
much time passed between the first and last session), and (d) activities or incentives used to increase compliance.

When  an  instrument  is  translated  into  a  language  other  than  the  language  in  which  it  was  developed,  describe  the  specific
method  of  translation  (e.g.,  back-translation,  in  which  a  text  is  translated  into  another  language  and  then  back  into  the  first
language to ensure that it is equivalent enough that results can be compared).

Describe  how  participants  were  grouped  during  data  acquisition  (i.e.,  was  the  manipulation  or  intervention  administered
individual  by  individual,  in  small  groups,  or  in  intact  groupings  such  as  classrooms?).  Indentify  the  smallest  unit  (e.g.,
individuals, work groups, classes) that was analyzed to assess effects. If the unit used for statistical analysis differed from the
unit used to deliver the intervention or manipulation (i.e., from the unit of randomization), describe the analytic method used to
account for this (e.g., adjusting the standard error estimates, using multilevel analysis).

Data  Diagnosis.  Describe  how  data  were  inspected  after  collection  and,  if  relevant,  any  modifications  of  those  data.  These
procedures  may  include  outlier  detection  and  processing,  data  transformations  based  on  empirical  data  distributions,  and
treatment of missing data or imputation of missing values.

107

Analytic Strategies. Describe the quantitative analytic strategies (usually statistical) used in analysis of the data, being careful
to describe error-rate considerations (e.g., experiment-wise, false discovery rate). The analytic strategies should be described for
primary, secondary, and exploratory hypotheses. Exploratory hypotheses are ones that were suggested by the data collected in
the study being reported, as opposed to ones generated by theoretical considerations or previously reported empirical studies.

When applying inferential statistics, take seriously the statistical power considerations associated with the tests of hypotheses.
Such considerations relate to the likelihood of correctly rejecting the tested hypotheses given a particular alpha level, effect size,
and sample size. In that regard, provide evidence that the study has sufficient power to detect effects of substantive interest. Be
careful in discussing the role played by sample size in cases in which not rejecting the null hypothesis is desirable (i.e., when
one  wishes  to  argue  that  there  are  no  differences),  when  testing  various  assumptions  underlying  the  statistical  model  adopted
(e.g., normality, homogeneity of variance, homogeneity of regression), and in model fitting. Alternatively, use calculations based
on  a  chosen  target  precision  (confidence  interval  width)  to  determine  sample  sizes.  Use  the  resulting  confidence  intervals  to
justify conclusions reached concerning effect sizes.

3.7 Quantitative Results Standards
In the Results section of a quantitative paper, summarize the collected data and the results of any analyses performed on those
data  relevant  to  the  discourse  that  is  to  follow.  Report  the  data  in  sufficient  detail  to  justify  your  conclusions.  Mention  all
relevant results, regardless of whether your hypotheses were supported, including results that run counter to expectation; include
small effect sizes (or statistically nonsignificant findings) when theory predicts large (or statistically significant) ones. Do not
hide uncomfortable results by omission. In the spirit of data sharing (encouraged by APA and other professional associations and
sometimes required by funding agencies; see Section 1.14), raw data, including study characteristics and individual effect sizes
used  in  a  meta-analysis,  can  be  made  available  as  supplemental  materials  (see  Section 2.15)  or  archived  online  (see  Section
10.9).  However,  raw  data  (and  individual  scores)  generally  are  not  presented  in  the  body  of  the  article  because  of  length
considerations. The implications of the results should be discussed in the Discussion section.

Participant Flow. For experimental and quasi-experimental designs, provide a description of the flow of participants (humans,
nonhuman animals, or units such as classrooms or hospital wards) through the study. Present the total number of participants
recruited into the study and the number of participants assigned to each group. Provide the number of participants who did not
complete the experiment or who crossed over to other conditions and explain why. Note the number of participants used in the
primary analyses. (This number might differ from the number who completed the study because participants might not show up
for  or  complete  the  final  measurement.)  See  Figure  7.5  in  Section  7.36  for  an  example  flowchart  that  displays  the  flow  of
participants through each stage of a study.

Recruitment. Provide  dates  defining  the  periods  of  recruitment  and  follow-up  and  the  primary  sources  of  participants,  when
appropriate. If recruitment and follow-up dates differ by group, provide the dates for each group.

Statistics and Data Analysis. Analyses of the data and reporting of the results of those analyses are fundamental aspects of the
conduct of research. Accurate, unbiased, complete, and insightful reporting of the analytic treatment of data (be it quantitative or
qualitative) must be a component of all research reports. Researchers in the field of psychology use numerous approaches to the
analysis of data, and no one approach is uniformly preferred as long as the method is appropriate to the research questions being
asked  and  the  nature  of  the  data  collected.  The  methods  used  must  support  their  analytic  burdens,  including  robustness  to
violations of the assumptions that underlie them, and must provide clear, unequivocal insights into the data. In reporting your
statistical and data analyses, adhere to the organizational structure suggested in the Method section (see Section 3.6):  primary
hypotheses, secondary hypotheses, and exploratory hypotheses. Ensure that you have reported the results of data diagnoses (see
Section 3.6) in the Method section before you report the results linked to hypothesis confirmation or disconfirmation. Discuss
any exclusions, transformations, or imputation decisions that resulted from the data diagnosis.

Historically, researchers in psychology have relied heavily on null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) as a starting point
for  many  of  their  analytic  approaches.  Different  fields  and  publishers  have  different  policies;  APA,  for  example,  stresses  that
NHST  is  but  a  starting  point  and  that  additional  reporting  elements  such  as  effect  sizes,  confidence  intervals,  and  extensive
description are needed to convey the most complete meaning of the results (Wilkinson & the Task Force on Statistical Inference,
1999; see also APA, n.d.-b). The degree to which any journal emphasizes NHST is a decision of the individual editor. However,
complete reporting of all tested hypotheses and estimates of appropriate effect sizes and confidence intervals are the minimum

108

expectations for all APA journals. Researchers are always responsible for the accurate and responsible reporting of the results of
their research study.

Assume that readers have a professional knowledge of statistical methods. Do not review basic concepts and procedures or
provide citations for the most commonly used statistical procedures. If, however, there is any question about the appropriateness
of a particular statistical procedure, justify its use by clearly stating the evidence that exists for the robustness of the procedure as
applied.

Missing Data. Missing  data  can  have  a  detrimental  effect  on  the  legitimacy  of  the  inferences  drawn  by  statistical  tests.  It  is
critical  that  the  frequency  or  percentages  of  missing  data  be  reported  along  with  any  empirical  evidence  and/or  theoretical
arguments for the causes of data that are missing. Data might be described as missing completely at random (as when values of
the missing variable are not related to the probability that they are missing or to the value of any other variable in the data set),
missing at random (as when the probability of missing a value on a variable is not related to the missing value itself but may be
related to other completely observed variables in the data set), or not missing at random (as when the probability of observing a
given  value  for  a  variable  is  related  to  the  missing  value  itself).  It  is  also  important  to  describe  the  methods  for  addressing
missing data, if any were used (e.g., multiple imputation).

Reporting  Results  of  Inferential  Statistical  Tests. When  reporting  the  results  of  inferential  statistical  tests  or  when  providing
estimates  of  parameters  or  effect  sizes,  include  sufficient  information  to  help  readers  fully  understand  the  analyses  conducted
and possible alternative explanations for the outcomes of those analyses. Because each analytic technique depends on different
aspects of the data and assumptions, it is impossible to specify what constitutes a “sufficient set of statistics” in general terms.
However, such a set usually includes at least the following: per-cell sample sizes, observed cell means (or frequencies of cases in
each category for a categorical variable), and cell standard deviations or pooled within-cell variance. In the case of multivariable
analytic systems, such as multivariate analyses of variance, regression analyses, structural equation modeling, and hierarchical
linear modeling, the associated means, sample sizes, and variance–covariance (or correlation) matrix or matrices often represent
a sufficient set of statistics. At times, the amount of information that constitutes a sufficient set of statistics is extensive; when
this  is  the  case,  the  information  could  be  supplied  in  a  supplementary  data  set  or  an  appendix  (see  Sections  2.14–2.15).  For
analyses based on small samples (including N-of-1 investigations; see Section 3.10), consider providing the complete set of raw
data  in  a  table  or  figure,  provided  that  confidentiality  can  be  maintained.  Your  work  will  more  easily  become  a  part  of  the
cumulative knowledge of the field if you include enough statistical information to allow its inclusion in future meta-analyses.

For inferential statistical tests (e.g., t, F, and chi-square tests), include the obtained magnitude or value of the test statistic, the
degrees of freedom, the probability of obtaining a value as extreme as or more extreme than the one obtained (exact p value),
and the size and direction of the effect. When point estimates (e.g., sample means, regression coefficients) are provided, always
include an associated measure of variability (precision), with an indication of the specific measure used (e.g., standard error).

Inclusion  of  Confidence  Intervals. It  can  be  extremely  effective  to  include  confidence  intervals  (for  estimates  of  parameters;
functions  of  parameters,  such  as  differences  in  means;  and  effect  sizes)  when  reporting  results.  Because  confidence  intervals
combine information on location and precision and can be directly used to infer significance levels, they are generally the best
reporting  strategy.  As  a  rule,  it  is  best  to  use  a  single  confidence  level,  specified  on  an  a  priori  basis  (e.g.,  a  95%  or  99%
confidence interval), throughout the article. Wherever possible, base discussion and interpretation of results on point and interval
estimates.

When using complex data-analytic techniques—such as structural equation modeling, Bayesian techniques, hierarchical linear
modeling, factor analysis, multivariate analysis, and similar approaches—provide details of the models estimated (see Section
3.11). Also provide (usually in supplemental materials) the associated variance–covariance (or correlation) matrices. Identify the
software used to run the analysis (e.g., SAS PROC GLM or a particular R package) and any parametric settings used in running
the  analyses  (references  are  not  necessary  for  these  software  programs).  Report  any  estimation  problems  (e.g.,  failure  to
converge),  regression  diagnosis  issues,  or  analytic  anomalies.  Report  any  problems  with  statistical  assumptions  or  data  issues
that might affect the validity of the findings.

Effect  Sizes.  For  readers  to  appreciate  the  magnitude  or  importance  of  a  study’s  findings,  it  is  recommended  to  include  some
measure  of  effect  size  in  the  Results  section.  Effect  sizes  are  statistical  estimates;  therefore,  whenever  possible,  provide  a
confidence  interval  for  each  effect  size  reported  to  indicate  the  precision  of  estimation  of  the  effect  size.  Effect  sizes  may  be
expressed in the original units (e.g., mean number of questions answered correctly, kilograms per month for a regression slope)
and are most easily understood when reported as such. It is valuable to also report an effect size in some standardized or units-
free  or  scale-free  unit  (e.g.,  Cohen’s  d  value)  or  a  standardized  regression  weight.  Multiple  degree-of-freedom  effect-size

109

indicators  are  less  useful  than  effect-size  indicators  that  decompose  multiple  degree-of-freedom  tests  into  meaningful  one
degree-of-freedom effects, particularly when the latter are the results that inform the discussion. The general principle to follow
is to provide readers with enough information to assess the magnitude of the observed effect.

Studies  With  Experimental  Manipulations  or  Interventions. In  studies  reporting  the  results  of  experimental  manipulations  or
interventions, clarify whether the analysis was by intent to treat. That is, were all participants assigned to conditions included in
the  data  analysis  regardless  of  whether  they  actually  received  the  intervention,  or  were  only  participants  who  completed  the
intervention satisfactorily included? Give a rationale for the choice.

Ancillary Analyses. Report any other analyses performed, including subgroup analyses and adjusted analyses, indicating those
that  were  prespecified  and  those  that  were  exploratory  (although  not  necessarily  in  the  level  of  detail  of  primary  analyses).
Consider  putting  the  detailed  results  of  ancillary  analyses  in  supplemental  materials.  Discuss  the  implications,  if  any,  of  the
ancillary analyses for statistical error rates.

Baseline Data. Be sure to provide baseline demographic and/or clinical characteristics of each group.

Adverse  Events.  If  interventions  were  studied,  detail  all  important  adverse  events  (i.e.,  events  with  serious  consequences)
and/or side effects in each intervention group. If none occurred, note this as well.

3.8 Quantitative Discussion Standards
After  presenting  the  results,  you  are  in  a  position  to  evaluate  and  interpret  their  implications,  especially  with  respect  to  your
original hypotheses. In the Discussion section of a quantitative paper, examine, interpret, and qualify the results of your research
and draw inferences and conclusions from them. In the case of empirical studies, there should be a tight relationship between the
results  that  are  reported  and  their  discussion.  Emphasize  any  theoretical  or  practical  consequences  of  the  results.  When  the
discussion is relatively brief and straightforward, you can combine it with the Results section, creating a section called “Results
and  Discussion.”  If  a  manuscript  presents  multiple  studies,  discuss  the  findings  in  the  order  that  the  studies  were  presented
within the article.

Open the Discussion section with a clear statement of support or nonsupport for all hypotheses, distinguished by primary and
secondary hypotheses. In the case of ambiguous outcomes, explain why the results are judged as such. Discuss the implications
of exploratory analyses in terms of both substantive findings and error rates that may be uncontrolled.

Similarities and differences between your results and the work of others (where they exist) should be used to contextualize,
confirm, and clarify your conclusions. Do not simply reformulate and repeat points already made; each new statement should
contribute to your interpretation and to readers’ understanding of the problem.

Limitations and Strengths. Your interpretation of the results should take into account (a) sources of potential bias and other
threats to internal validity, (b) the imprecision of measures, (c) the overall number of tests and/or overlap among tests, (d) the
adequacy  of  sample  sizes  and  sampling  validity,  and  (e)  other  limitations  or  weaknesses  of  the  study.  If  an  intervention  or
manipulation is involved, discuss whether it was successfully implemented, and note the mechanism by which it was intended to
work (i.e., its causal pathways and/or alternative mechanisms). Discuss the fidelity with which the intervention or manipulation
was implemented, and describe the barriers that were responsible for any lack of fidelity. Acknowledge the limitations of your
research,  and  address  alternative  explanations  of  the  results.  Discuss  the  generalizability,  or  external  validity,  of  the  findings.
This  critical  analysis  should  take  into  account  differences  between  the  target  population  and  the  accessed  sample.  For
interventions,  discuss  characteristics  that  make  them  more  or  less  applicable  to  circumstances  not  included  in  the  study,  what
outcomes were measured and how (relative to other measures that might have been used), the length of time to measurement
(between  the  end  of  the  intervention  and  the  measurement  of  outcomes),  incentives,  compliance  rates,  and  specific  settings
involved in the study as well as other contextual issues.

Study Implications. End the Discussion section with a reasoned and justifiable commentary on the importance of your findings.
This concluding section may be brief, or it may be extensive if it is tightly reasoned, self-contained, and not overstated. In the
conclusion, consider returning to a discussion of why the problem is important (as stated in the introduction); what larger issues,
meaning those that transcend the particulars of the subfield, might hinge on the findings; and what propositions are confirmed or
disconfirmed by the extrapolation of these findings to such overarching issues.

Also consider the following issues:

110

What is the theoretical, clinical, or practical significance of the outcomes, and what is the basis for these interpretations?

If  the  findings  are  valid  and  replicable,  what  real-life  psychological  phenomena  might  be  explained  or  modeled  by  the
results?

Are applications warranted on the basis of this research?

What problems remain unresolved or arise anew because of these findings?

The responses to these questions are the core of the contribution of your study and justify why readers both inside and outside
your specialty should attend to the findings. Readers should receive clear, unambiguous, and direct answers.

3.9 Additional Reporting Standards for Typical Experimental and Nonexperimental Studies
As mentioned in Section 3.5, the reporting standards in Table 3.1  apply  to  all  quantitative  studies.  Additional  standards  apply
because  of  particular  design  features  or  empirical  claims  made.  Studies  with  experimental  (e.g.,  studies  using  random
assignment,  studies  using  nonrandom  assignment,  clinical  trials)  and  nonexperimental  designs  have  these  additional  specific
reporting  standards.  See  Figure  3.1  for  a  flowchart  of  what  standards  to  use  for  your  research  and  links  to  the  associated
standards on the JARS website.

Studies Using Random Assignment. Describe the unit of randomization and the procedures used to generate assignments. Be
careful to note when units such as classrooms are the unit of randomization, even though data collection may be from individual
students  within  the  classroom.  Indicate  the  unit  of  randomization  in  the  analysis  of  such  study  outcomes  as  well.  Describe
masking provisions used to ensure the quality of the randomization process.

Studies Using Nonrandom Assignment. Describe the unit of assignment and the method (rules) used to assign the unit to the
condition, including details of any assignment restrictions such as blocking, stratification, and so forth. Describe any procedures
used to minimize selection bias such as matching or propensity score matching.

Clinical Trials. Within the JARS context, a clinical trial or a randomized clinical trial is a research investigation that evaluates
the  effects  of  one  or  more  health-related  interventions  (e.g.,  psychotherapy,  medication)  on  health  outcomes  by  prospectively
assigning people to experimental conditions. As used here, a clinical trial is a subset of a class of studies called “randomized
control studies,” and the reporting standards for clinical trials apply to randomized control studies as well. Most clinical trials are
experimental studies with random assignment, so all reporting standards for those types of studies also apply. Report information
about the clinical trial aspect of the study. If the trial has been registered (e.g., on ClinicalTrials.gov), report its registration on
the  title  page  in  the  author  note  (see  Section 2.7)  and  in  the  text.  In  the  Method  section,  provide  details  of  any  site-specific
considerations  if  the  trial  is  a  multisite  trial.  Provide  access  to  the  study  protocol;  if  the  study  is  a  comparison  to  a  current
“standard” treatment, describe that standard treatment in sufficient detail that it can be accurately replicated in any follow-up or
replication study. Describe the data safety and monitoring board and any stopping rules if used. If there was a follow-up, provide
the rationale for the length of the follow-up period.

Nonexperimental Designs. Nonexperimental studies (in which no variable is manipulated) are sometimes called, among other
things, “observational,” “correlational,” or “natural history” studies. Their purpose is to observe, describe, classify, or analyze
naturally  occurring  relationships  between  variables  of  interest.  In  general,  describe  the  design  of  the  study,  methods  of
participant  selection  and  sampling  (e.g.,  prospective,  retrospective,  case-control,  cohort,  cohort-sequential),  and  data  sources.
Define all variables and describe the comparability of assessment across natural groups. Indicate how predictors, confounders,
and effect modifiers were included in the analysis. Discuss the potential limitations of the study as relevant (e.g., the possibility
of unmeasured confounding).

3.10 Reporting Standards for Special Designs
Studies with some special designs (e.g., longitudinal, N-of-1, replication) have specific reporting standards. See Figure 3.1 for a
flowchart of what standards to use for your research, including studies with special designs, and links to the associated standards
on the JARS website.

Longitudinal  Studies.  A  longitudinal  study  involves  the  observation  of  the  same  individuals  using  the  same  set  of
measurements (or attributes) at multiple times or occasions. This multiple observational structure may be combined with other

111

research  designs,  including  those  with  and  without  experimental  manipulations,  randomized  clinical  trials,  or  any  other  study
type.  Reporting  standards  for  longitudinal  studies  must  combine  those  for  the  basic  underlying  study  structure  with  those
specific to a longitudinal study.

Thus, in addition to the information dictated by the underlying structure of the study, report information about the longitudinal
aspects of the study. For example, describe sample recruitment and retention methods, including attrition at each wave of data
collection and how any missing data were handled. Describe any contextual changes that occurred during the progress of the
study (e.g., a major economic recession). Report any changes in instrumentation that occurred over the course of the study, such
as a change in level of a measure of school achievement. Because longitudinal studies are often reported in a segmental fashion,
report  where  any  portions  of  the  data  have  been  previously  published  and  the  degree  of  overlap  with  the  current  report  (see
Section 1.16).

N-of-1 Studies. Studies with N-of-1 designs occur in several different forms; however, the essential feature of all these designs
is that the unit of study is a single entity (usually a person). In some N-of-1 studies, several individual results are described, and
consistency  of  results  may  be  a  central  point  of  the  discussion.  No  N-of-1  study,  however,  combines  the  results  from  several
cases (e.g., by computing averages).

Describe  the  design  type  (e.g.,  withdrawal–reversal,  multiple  baseline,  alternating–simultaneous  treatments,  changing
criterion)  and  its  phases  and  phase  sequence  when  one  or  more  manipulations  have  been  used.  Indicate  whether  and  how
randomization was used. For each participant, report the sequence actually completed and the participant’s results, including raw
data for target behaviors and other outcomes.

Replication  Articles.  For  a  replication  article  (see  Section  1.4),  indicate  the  type  of  replication  (e.g.,  direct  [exact,  literal],
approximate,  conceptual  [construct]).  Provide  comparisons  between  the  original  study  and  the  replication  being  reported  so
readers  can  evaluate  the  degree  to  which  there  may  be  factors  present  that  would  contribute  to  any  differences  between  the
findings of the original study and the findings of the replication being reported. Compare recruitment procedures; demographic
characteristics  of  participants;  and  instrumentation,  including  hardware  and  “soft”  measures  (e.g.,  questionnaires,  interviews,
psychological  tests),  modifications  made  to  measures  (e.g.,  translation  or  back-translation),  psychometric  characteristics  of
scores  analyzed,  and  informants  and  methods  of  administration  (e.g.,  paper-and-pencil  vs.  online).  Report  results  of  the  same
analytic methods (statistical or other quantitative manipulations) used in the original study, as well as any results from additional
or different analyses. Report in detail the rules (e.g., comparison of effect sizes) that were used in deciding the degree to which
the original results were replicated in the new study being reported.

3.11 Standards for Analytic Approaches
Although reporting standards are generally associated with entire research designs, some quantitative procedures (e.g., structural
equation  modeling,  Bayesian  techniques)  are  of  sufficient  complexity  and  open  to  such  internal  variation  that  additional
information  (beyond  just  the  name  of  the  technique  and  a  few  parameters)  must  be  reported  for  readers  to  be  able  to  fully
comprehend the analysis. Other researchers may need additional information to evaluate the conclusions the authors have drawn
or to replicate the analysis with their own data. Standards for structural equation modeling and Bayesian techniques are on the
JARS website (https://apastyle.apa.org/jars/quantitative).

Structural Equation Modeling. Structural equation modeling is a family of statistical techniques that involve the specification
of a structural or measurement model. The analysis involves steps that estimate the effects represented in the model (parameters)
and  evaluate  the  extent  of  correspondence  between  the  model  and  the  data.  These  standards  are  complex  and  call  for  a
comprehensive  description  of  data  preparation,  specification  of  the  initial  model(s),  estimation,  model  fit  assessment,
respecification of the model(s), and reporting of results.

Bayesian Techniques. Bayesian techniques are inferential statistical procedures in which researchers estimate parameters of an
underlying  distribution  on  the  basis  of  the  observed  distribution.  These  standards  are  complex  and  address  the  needs  of  this
analytic  approach,  including  how  to  specify  the  model,  describe  and  plot  the  distributions,  describe  the  computation  of  the
model, report any Bayes factors, and report Bayesian model averaging.

3.12 Quantitative Meta-Analysis Standards

112

Quantitative  meta-analyses  (see  Section 1.5)  have  specific  reporting  standards  that  are  available  in  full  on  the  JARS  website
(https://apastyle.apa.org/jars/quant-table-9.pdf). These standards are specific to meta-analyses but can easily generalize to other
quantitative research synthesis approaches. One feature of meta-analyses that makes them different (in reporting demands) from
other study types is that the units of analysis are research reports—usually articles that have been published or archived. The
primary features of the included studies are numerical estimates of the effect sizes of the phenomena of interest. The reporting
standards for quantitative meta-analyses are complex and include how to describe study selection, study inclusion and exclusion
criteria, and data collection, as well as how to summarize the selected studies and their characteristics (e.g., through tables and
figures; see Table 7.4 in Section 7.21 for a sample summary meta-analysis table).

Reporting Standards for Qualitative Research

3.13 Basic Expectations for Qualitative Research Reporting

Whereas standards for reporting information in the abstract and introduction of a paper are common to all kinds of research (see
Sections 3.3–3.4), there are  specific  reporting  standards  for  qualitative  research  articles,  including  the  Method  (Section 3.14),
Findings or Results (Section 3.15), and Discussion (Section 3.16) sections. Standards specific to quantitative and mixed methods
research are presented in Sections 3.5 to 3.12 and 3.18, respectively.

The basic expectations for reporting qualitative research are presented in Table 3.2. An additional table on the JARS website
describes  the  reporting  standards  for  qualitative  meta-analyses  (see  Section 3.17).  There  are  many  qualitative  procedures  and
methods as well as many designs and approaches to inquiry in which they can be embedded; because of this variation, all the
elements described in Table 3.2 and the guidelines in Sections 3.14 to 3.16 may not be appropriate for all qualitative studies.

113

Table 3.2 Qualitative Design Reporting Standards (JARS–Qual)

Title Page

Title

Identify key issues/topic under consideration.

Author Note

Acknowledge funding sources or contributors.
Acknowledge conflicts of interest, if any.

Abstract

State the problem/question/objectives under investigation.
Indicate the study design, including types of participants or data sources, analytic strategy, main results/findings, and main
implications/significance.
Identify five keywords.

Guidance for Authors

Consider including at least one keyword that describes the method and one that describes the types of participants or phenomena under
investigation.
Consider describing your approach to inquiry when it will facilitate the review process and intelligibility of your paper. If your work is not
grounded in a specific approach to inquiry or your approach would be too complicated to explain in the allotted word count, however, it
would not be advisable to provide explication on this point in the abstract.

Introduction

Description of Research Problem or Question

Frame the problem or question and its context.
Review, critique, and synthesize the applicable literature to identify key issues/debates/theoretical frameworks in the relevant literature to
clarify barriers, knowledge gaps, or practical needs.

Guidance for Reviewers

The introduction may include case examples, personal narratives, vignettes, or other illustrative material.

Study Objectives/Aims/Research Goals

State the purpose(s)/goal(s)/aim(s) of the study.
State the target audience, if specific.
Provide the rationale for fit of design used to investigate this purpose/goal (e.g., theory building, explanatory, developing understanding,
social action, description, highlighting social practices).
Describe the approach to inquiry, if it illuminates the objectives and research rationale (e.g., descriptive, interpretive, feminist,
psychoanalytic, postpositivist, critical, postmodern, constructivist, or pragmatic approaches).

Guidance for Authors

If relevant to objectives, explain the relation of the current analysis to prior articles/publications.

Guidance for Reviewers

Qualitative studies often legitimately need to be divided into multiple manuscripts because of journal article page limitations, but each
manuscript should have a separate focus.
Qualitative studies tend not to identify hypotheses, but rather research questions and goals.

Method

Research Design Overview

Summarize the research design, including data-collection strategies, data-analytic strategies, and, if illuminating, approaches to inquiry (e.g.,
descriptive, interpretive, feminist, psychoanalytic, postpositivist, critical, postmodern, constructivist, or pragmatic approaches).
Provide the rationale for the design selected.

Guidance for Reviewers

Method sections can be written in a chronological or narrative format.
Although authors provide a method description that other investigators should be able to follow, it is not required that other investigators
arrive at the same conclusions but rather that the method description leads other investigators to conclusions with a similar degree of
methodological integrity.
At times, elements may be relevant to multiple sections and authors need to organize what belongs in each subsection in order to
describe the method coherently and reduce redundancy. For instance, the overview and the objectives statement may be presented in
one section.
Processes of qualitative research are often iterative versus linear, may evolve through the inquiry process, and may move between data
collection and analysis in multiple formats. As a result, data collection and analysis sections might be combined.

114

For the reasons stated previously and because qualitative methods often are adapted and combined creatively, requiring detailed
description and rationale, an average qualitative Method section typically is longer than an average quantitative Method section.

Study Participants or Data Sources

RESEARCHER DESCRIPTION

Describe the researchers’ backgrounds in approaching the study, emphasizing their prior understandings of the phenomena under study
(e.g., interviewers, analysts, or research team).
Describe how prior understandings of the phenomena under study were managed and/or influenced the research (e.g., enhancing, limiting,
or structuring data collection and analysis).

Guidance for Authors

Prior understandings relevant to the analysis could include, but are not limited to, descriptions of researchers’ demographic/cultural
characteristics, credentials, experience with phenomena, training, values, and/or decisions in selecting archives or material to analyze.

Guidance for Reviewers

Researchers differ in the extensiveness of reflexive self-description in reports. It may not be possible for authors to estimate the depth of
description desired by reviewers without guidance.

PARTICIPANTS OR OTHER DATA SOURCES

Provide the numbers of participants/documents/events analyzed.
Describe the demographics/cultural information, perspectives of participants, or characteristics of data sources that might influence the data
collected.
Describe existing data sources, if relevant (e.g., newspapers, internet, archive).
Provide data repository information for openly shared data, if applicable.
Describe archival searches or process of locating data for analyses, if applicable.

RESEARCHER–PARTICIPANT RELATIONSHIP

Describe the relationships and interactions between researchers and participants relevant to the research process and any impact on the
research process (e.g., was there a relationship prior to research, are there any ethical considerations relevant to prior relationships).

Participant Recruitment

RECRUITMENT PROCESS

Describe the recruitment process (e.g., face-to-face, telephone, mail, email) and any recruitment protocols.
Describe any incentives or compensation, and provide assurance of relevant ethical processes of data collection and consent process as
relevant (may include institutional review board approval, particular adaptations for vulnerable populations, safety monitoring).
Describe the process by which the number of participants was determined in relation to the study design.
Provide any changes in numbers through attrition and final number of participants/sources (if relevant, refusal rates or reasons for dropout).
Describe the rationale for decision to halt data collection (e.g., saturation).
Convey the study purpose as portrayed to participants, if different from the purpose stated.

Guidance for Authors/Reviewers

The order of the recruitment process and the selection process and their contents may be determined in relation to the authors’
methodological approach. Some authors will determine a selection process and then develop a recruitment method based on those
criteria. Other authors will develop a recruitment process and then select participants responsively in relation to evolving findings.

Guidance for Reviewers

There is no agreed-upon minimum number of participants for a qualitative study. Rather, the author should provide a rationale for the
number of participants chosen.

PARTICIPANT SELECTION

Describe the participant/data source selection process (e.g., purposive sampling methods, such as maximum variation; convenience
sampling methods, such as snowball selection; theoretical sampling; diversity sampling) and inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Provide the general context for the study (when data were collected, sites of data collection).
If your participant selection is from an archived data set, describe the recruitment and selection process from that data set as well as any
decisions in selecting sets of participants from that data set.

Guidance for Authors

A statement can clarify how the number of participants fits with practices in the design at hand, recognizing that transferability of findings
in qualitative research to other contexts is based in developing deep and contextualized understandings that can be applied by readers
rather than quantitative estimates of error and generalizations to populations.

Guidance for Authors/Reviewers

The order of the recruitment process and the selection process and their contents may be determined in relation to the authors’
methodological approach. Some authors will determine a selection process and then develop a recruitment method based on those
criteria. Other authors will develop a recruitment process and then select participants responsively in relation to evolving findings.

Data Collection

DATA–COLLECTION OR IDENTIFICATION PROCEDURES

State the form of data collected (e.g., interviews, questionnaires, media, observation).
Describe the origins or evolution of the data-collection protocol.

115

Describe any alterations of data-collection strategy in response to the evolving findings or the study rationale.
Describe the data-selection or data-collection process (e.g., were others present when data were collected, number of times data were
collected, duration of collection, context).
Convey the extensiveness of engagement (e.g., depth of engagement, time intensiveness of data collection).
For interview and written studies, indicate the mean and range of the time duration in the data-collection process (e.g., interviews were held
for 75 to 110 min, with an average interview time of 90 min).
Describe the management or use of reflexivity in the data-collection process, as it illuminates the study.
Describe questions asked in data collection: content of central questions, form of questions (e.g., open vs. closed).

Guidance for Reviewers

Researchers may use terms for data collection that are coherent within their research approach and process, such as “data identification,”
“data collection,” or “data selection.” Descriptions should be provided, however, in accessible terms in relation to the readership.
It may not be useful for researchers to reproduce all of the questions they asked in an interview, especially in the case of unstructured or
semistructured interviews as questions are adapted to the content of each interview.

RECORDING AND DATA TRANSFORMATION

Identify data audio/visual recording methods, field notes, or transcription processes used.

Analysis

DATA–ANALYTIC STRATEGIES

Describe the methods and procedures used and for what purpose/goal.
Explicate in detail the process of analysis, including some discussion of the procedures (e.g., coding, thematic analysis) following a principle
of transparency.
Describe coders or analysts and their training, if not already described in the researcher description section (e.g., coder selection,
collaboration groups).
Identify whether coding categories emerged from the analyses or were developed a priori.
Identify units of analysis (e.g., entire transcript, unit, text) and how units were formed, if applicable.
Describe the process of arriving at an analytic scheme, if applicable (e.g., if one was developed before or during the analysis or was
emergent throughout).
Provide illustrations and descriptions of the analytic scheme development, if relevant.
Indicate software, if used.

Guidance for Authors

Provide rationales to illuminate analytic choices in relation to the study goals.

Guidance for Reviewers

Researchers may use terms for data analysis that are coherent within their research approach and process (e.g., “interpretation,”
“unitization,” “eidetic analysis,” “coding”). Descriptions should be provided, however, in accessible terms in relation to the readership.

METHODOLOGICAL INTEGRITY

Demonstrate that the claims made from the analysis are warranted and have produced findings with methodological integrity. The
procedures that support methodological integrity (i.e., fidelity and utility) typically are described across the relevant sections of a paper, but
they could be addressed in a separate section when elaboration or emphasis would be helpful. Issues of methodological integrity include the
following:

Assess the adequacy of the data in terms of the ability to capture forms of diversity most relevant to the question, research goals, and
inquiry approach.
Describe how the researchers’ perspectives were managed in both the data collection and analysis (e.g., to limit their effect on the data
collection, to structure the analysis).
Demonstrate that findings are grounded in the evidence (e.g., using quotes, excerpts, or descriptions of researchers’ engagement in data
collection).
Demonstrate that the contributions are insightful and meaningful (e.g., in relation to the current literature and the study goal).
Provide relevant contextual information for findings (e.g., setting of study, information about participants, interview question asked is
presented before excerpt as needed).
Present findings in a coherent manner that makes sense of contradictions or disconfirming evidence in the data (e.g., reconcile
discrepancies, describe why a conflict might exist in the findings).

Demonstrate consistency with regard to the analytic processes (e.g., analysts may use demonstrations of analyses to support consistency,
describe their development of a stable perspective, interrater reliability, consensus) or describe responses to inconsistencies, as relevant
(e.g., coders switching midway through analysis, an interruption in the analytic process). If alterations in methodological integrity were made
for ethical reasons, explicate those reasons and the adjustments made.
Describe how support for claims was supplemented by any checks added to the qualitative analysis. Examples of supplemental checks that
can strengthen the research may include

transcripts/data collected returned to participants for feedback
triangulation across multiple sources of information, findings, or investigators
checks on the interview thoroughness or interviewer demands
consensus or auditing process
member checks or participant feedback on findings

116

data displays/matrices
in-depth thick description, case examples, or illustrations
structured methods of researcher reflexivity (e.g., sending memos, field notes, diary, logbooks, journals, bracketing)
checks on the utility of findings in responding to the study problem (e.g., an evaluation of whether a solution worked)

Guidance for Reviewers

Research does not need to use all or any of the checks (as rigor is centrally based in the iterative process of qualitative analyses, which
inherently includes checks within the evolving, self-correcting iterative analyses), but their use can augment a study’s methodological
integrity. Approaches to inquiry have different traditions in terms of using checks and which checks are most valued.

Describe research findings (e.g., themes, categories, narratives) and the meaning and understandings that the researcher has derived from
the data analysis.
Demonstrate the analytic process of reaching findings (e.g., quotes, excerpts of data).

Findings/Results

Findings/Results Subsections

Present research findings in a way that is compatible with the study design.
Present synthesizing illustrations (e.g., diagrams, tables, models), if useful in organizing and conveying findings. Photographs or links to
videos can be used.

Guidance for Authors

Findings presented in an artistic manner (e.g., a link to a dramatic presentation of findings) should also include information in the
reporting standards to support the research presentation.
Use quotes or excerpts to augment data description (e.g., thick, evocative description, field notes, text excerpts), but these should not
replace the description of the findings of the analysis.

Guidance for Reviewers

The Findings section tends to be longer than in quantitative papers because of the demonstrative rhetoric needed to permit the evaluation
of the analytic procedure.
Depending on the approach to inquiry, findings and discussion may be combined or a personalized discursive style might be used to
portray the researchers’ involvement in the analysis.
Findings may or may not include quantified information, depending upon the study’s goals, approach to inquiry, and study characteristics.

Discussion

Discussion Subsections

Describe the central contributions and their significance in advancing disciplinary understandings.
Describe the types of contributions made by findings (e.g., challenging, elaborating on, and supporting prior research or theory in the
literature describing the relevance) and how findings can be best utilized.
Identify similarities and differences from prior theories and research findings.
Reflect on any alternative explanations of the findings.
Identify the study’s strengths and limitations (e.g., consider how the quality, source, or types of the data or the analytic processes might
support or weaken its methodological integrity).
Describe the limits of the scope of transferability (e.g., what readers should bear in mind when using findings across contexts).
Revisit any ethical dilemmas or challenges that were encountered, and provide related suggestions for future researchers.
Consider the implications for future research, policy, or practice.

Guidance for Reviewers

Accounts could lead to multiple solutions rather than a single one. Many qualitative approaches hold that there may be more than one
valid and useful set of findings from a given data set.

Authors  must  decide  how  sections  should  be  organized  within  the  context  of  their  specific  study.  For  example,  qualitative
researchers may combine the Results and Discussion sections because they may not find it possible to separate a given finding
from its interpreted meaning within a broader context. Qualitative researchers may also use headings that reflect the values in
their  tradition  (such  as  “Findings”  instead  of  “Results”)  and  omit  ones  that  do  not.  As  long  as  the  necessary  information  is
present, the paper does not need to be segmented into the same sections and subsections as a quantitative paper.

Qualitative papers may appear different from quantitative papers because they tend to be longer. This added length is due to
the following central features of qualitative reporting: (a) In place of referencing statistical analyses, researchers must include
detailed rationales and procedural descriptions to explain how an analytic method was selected, applied, and adapted to fit each
specific  question  or  context;  (b)  researchers  must  include  a  discussion  of  their  own  backgrounds  and  beliefs  and  how  they
managed them throughout the study; and (c) researchers must show how they moved from their raw data to develop findings by
adding quoted materials or other demonstrative evidence into their presentation of results. Because qualitative articles need to be
lengthier to provide the information necessary to support an adequate review, limitations on length should be more flexible than

117

they  are  for  quantitative  articles,  which  may  not  need  to  include  this  information.  When  journal  page  limits  conflict  with  the
length of a qualitative paper, qualitative researchers should work with journal editors to reach a solution that enables an adequate
review of the paper in question.

3.14 Qualitative Method Standards
The Method section of a qualitative article includes the following types of information (see also Table 3.2).

Research Design Overview. The Method section of a qualitative article begins with a paragraph that summarizes the research
design.  It  might  mention  the  data-collection  strategies,  data-analytic  strategies,  and  approaches  to  inquiry  and  provide  a  brief
rationale for the design selected if this was not described in the objectives section of the introduction (see Section 3.4).

Researcher Description. To situate the investigation within the expectations, identities, and positions of the researchers (e.g.,
interviewers, analysts, research team), describe the researchers’ backgrounds in approaching the study, emphasizing their prior
understandings  of  the  phenomena  under  study.  Descriptions  of  researchers  relevant  to  the  analysis  could  include  (but  are  not
limited to) their demographic, cultural, and/or identity characteristics; credentials; experience with the phenomena under study;
training; values; or decisions in selecting archives or material to analyze. Describe how prior understandings of the phenomena
under study were managed and/or how they influenced the research (e.g., by enhancing, limiting, or structuring data collection
and analysis).

Participants  or  Other  Data  Sources.  When  describing  participants  or  data  sources,  the  following  information  should  be
reported: number of participants, documents, or events that were analyzed; demographic or cultural information relevant to the
research topic; and perspectives of participants and characteristics of data sources relevant to the research topic. As applicable,
data sources should be described (e.g., newspapers, internet, archive). Information about data repositories used for openly shared
data should be reported if used. The processes entailed in performing archival searches or locating data for analysis should be
described as well.

Qualitative researchers should report participant characteristics (listed in Section 3.6) and personal history factors (e.g., age,
trauma  exposure,  abuse  history,  substance  abuse  history,  family  history,  geographic  history)  that  are  relevant  to  the  specific
contexts  and  topics  of  their  research  (see  Morse,  2008).  Certain  characteristics  hold  influence  across  many  spheres  of
participants’ lives within a given context and would be expected in most research reports; in the United States, these typically
include  age,  gender,  race,  ethnicity,  and  socioeconomic  status,  but  other  features  may  be  highly  relevant  as  well  to  a  given
research  question  and  context  (e.g.,  sexual  orientation,  immigration  status,  disability).  The  descriptions  of  participant
characteristics should be sensitive to the participants and the ways in which they understand and express their identities, statuses,
histories, and so forth. Chapter 5 contains further guidance on writing about participant characteristics without bias.

In  addition  to  participant  characteristics  and  personal  history  factors,  other  features  within  a  study  may  influence  the
experience of a given phenomenon (e.g., psychotherapy orientation in research on psychotherapists, political party membership
in  a  study  on  economic  beliefs)  and  therefore  are  important  to  report.  The  decision  of  which  participant  characteristics  and
features to report can be driven by a review of prior research, the researchers’ experience with a phenomenon, pilot interviews,
study  goals,  contextual  dynamics,  and  empirical  data  that  are  analyzed  as  the  data  collection  proceeds.  In  this  way,  reporting
considerations may be experientially, theoretically, and empirically driven.

Researcher–Participant  Relationships.  To  increase  transparency,  describe  the  relationships  and  interactions  between
researchers  and  participants  that  are  relevant  to  the  research  process  and  any  impact  on  the  research  process  (e.g.,  any
relationships prior to the study, any ethical considerations relevant to prior relationships). Existing relationships may be helpful
(e.g.,  by  increasing  trust  and  facilitating  disclosure)  or  harmful  (e.g.,  by  decreasing  trust  and  inhibiting  disclosure),  so  the
specific dynamics of the relationships should be considered and reported.

Participant  Recruitment.  There  is  no  minimum  number  of  participants  for  a  qualitative  study  (see  Levitt  et  al.,  2017,  for  a
discussion  on  adequacy  of  data  in  qualitative  research).  Authors  should  provide  a  rationale  for  the  number  of  participants
chosen,  often  in  light  of  the  method  or  approach  to  inquiry  that  is  used.  Some  studies  begin  with  researchers  recruiting
participants  to  the  study  and  then  selecting  participants  from  the  pool  that  responds.  Other  studies  begin  with  researchers
selecting a type of participant pool and then recruiting from within that pool. The content of Method sections should be ordered
to  reflect  the  study’s  process.  Specifically,  participant  selection  might  follow  participant  recruitment  or  vice  versa;  thus,
discussion of the number of participants is likely to be placed in reference to whichever process came second.

118

Recruitment Process. Report the method of recruitment (e.g., face-to-face, telephone, mail, email) and any recruitment protocols,
and describe how you conveyed the study purpose to participants, especially if it was different from the purpose stated in the
study objectives (see Section 3.4). For instance, researchers might describe a broader study aim to participants (e.g., to explore
participants’ experience of being on parole) but then focus their analysis in a specific manuscript on one aspect of that aim (e.g.,
the  relationships  between  participants  and  parole  officers).  Provide  details  on  any  incentives  or  compensation  given  to
participants, and state relevant ethical processes of data collection and consent, potentially describing institutional review board
approval,  any  adaptations  for  vulnerable  populations,  or  safety  monitoring  practices.  Present  the  process  for  determining  the
number  of  participants  in  relation  to  the  study  design  (e.g.,  approaches  to  inquiry,  data-collection  strategies,  data-analytic
strategies).  Any  changes  in  this  number  through  attrition  (e.g.,  refusal  rates,  reasons  for  dropout)  and  the  final  number  of
participants or sources should be conveyed, as should the rationale for decisions to halt data collection (e.g., saturation).

Participant Selection. To describe how participants were selected from within an identified group, explain any inclusion and/or
exclusion criteria as well as the participant and/or data source selection process that was used. This selection process can consist
of  purposive  sampling  methods,  such  as  maximum  variation;  convenience  sampling  methods,  such  as  snowball  selection;
theoretical sampling; or diversity sampling. Provide the general context for your study (e.g., when data were collected, sites of
data collection). If you selected participants from an archived data set, describe the recruitment and selection process for that
data set and any decisions affecting the selection of participants from that data set.

Data Collection. Researchers may use terms for data collection that are coherent with their research approach and process, such
as “data identification,” “collection,” or “selection.” Descriptions should be provided, however, in terms that are accessible to
readers.

Data-Collection  or  Identification  Procedures.  In  addition  to  describing  the  form  of  data  collected  (e.g.,  interviews,
questionnaires, media, observation), convey any alterations to the data-collection strategy (e.g., in response to evolving findings
or  the  study  rationale).  It  may  not  be  useful  to  reproduce  all  of  the  questions  asked  in  an  interview,  especially  in  the  case  of
unstructured or semi-structured interviews in which questions are adapted to the content of each interview. The content of central
or guiding questions should be communicated, however, and the format of the questions can be described (e.g., open questions,
nonleading  paraphrases,  written  prompts).  Describe  the  process  of  data  selection  or  data  collection  (e.g.,  whether  others  were
present  when  data  were  collected,  number  of  times  data  were  collected,  duration  of  collection,  context).  Convey  the
extensiveness  of  the  researchers’  engagement  (e.g.,  depth  of  engagement,  time  intensiveness  of  data  collection).  Describe  the
management or use of reflexivity in the data-collection process when it illuminates the study.

Recording  and  Data  Transformation. Identify  how  data  were  recorded  for  analysis  and  explain  whether  and  how  data  were
transformed. This might include a statement regarding audio or visual recording methods, field notes, or transcription.

Analysis. The two primary topics to report in the description of qualitative analyses are the data analysis and the establishment
of methodological integrity. Researchers may use terms for data analysis that are coherent within their research approach and
process (e.g., “interpretation,” “unitization,” “eidetic analysis,” “coding”). Descriptions should be provided, however, in terms
that are accessible to readers.

Data-Analytic Strategies.  Describe  the  methods  and  procedures  of  data  analysis  and  the  purpose  or  goal  for  which  they  were
used. Explain in detail the process of analysis. Describe the process of arriving at an analytic approach (e.g., whether a set of
categories of coding was developed before or during the analysis, whether findings emerged from an inductively driven process
of analysis; see the glossary on the JARS website at https://apastyle.apa.org/jars/glossary). Also include a discussion of analytic
procedures (e.g., coding, thematic analysis) and a description of coders or analysts and their training if not already described in
the researcher description section. In this description, identify units of analysis (e.g., entire transcript, unit, text) and how units
were formed, if applicable. Indicate whether any categories or codes emerged from the analyses or were developed a priori, and
outline the process used in each case. Provide illustrations and descriptions of their development, if relevant. Indicate software,
if used.

Methodological Integrity. Highlight procedures that support methodological integrity throughout the paper or summarize central
points in a separate section of the Method section when elaboration or emphasis would be helpful (for more on methodological
integrity, see Levitt et al., 2017, and the glossary on the JARS website at https://apastyle.apa.org/jars/glossary). Demonstrate that
the claims made from the analysis are warranted. Highlight key features of methodological integrity, as follows:

119

adequacy: Assess the adequacy of the data in terms of their ability to capture forms of diversity most relevant to the research
questions, research goals, and inquiry approach.

researchers’  perspectives:  Describe  how  the  researchers’  perspectives  were  managed  in  both  the  data  collection  and  the
analysis (e.g., to limit their effect on the data collection, to structure the analysis).

groundedness:  Demonstrate  that  findings  are  grounded  in  the  evidence  (e.g.,  using  quotes,  excerpts,  or  descriptions  of
researchers’ engagement in data collection).

meaningfulness: Demonstrate that the contributions are insightful and meaningful (e.g., in relation to the current literature
and the study goals).

context:  Provide  relevant  contextual  information  for  findings  (e.g.,  setting  of  the  study,  information  about  participants;
present the interview question asked before an excerpt as needed).

coherence: Present findings in a coherent manner that makes sense of contradictions or disconfirming evidence in the data
(e.g., reconcile discrepancies, describe why a conflict might exist in the findings).

consistency: As relevant, comment on consistency with regard to the analytic processes, especially in the face of changing
conditions or contexts (e.g., use demonstrations of analyses to support consistency or to describe the development of a stable
perspective,  such  as  through  the  use  of  interrater  reliability  or  consensus),  or  describe  responses  to  inconsistencies  (e.g.,
coders switching in the middle of analysis, an interruption in the analytic process).

Support  for  claims  of  methodological  integrity  may  be  supplemented  by  any  checks  added  to  the  qualitative  analysis.
Approaches to inquiry have different traditions in terms of using checks, and researchers do not need to use all or any of the
checks, but their use can augment a study’s methodological integrity. The following are examples of supplemental checks that
can strengthen the research:

transcripts or data returned to participants for feedback;
triangulation across multiple sources of information, findings, or investigators;
checks on interview thoroughness or interviewer demands;
consensus or auditing processes;
member checks or participant feedback on findings;
data displays or matrices;
in-depth thick description, case examples, and illustrations;
structured methods of researcher reflexivity (e.g., memos, field notes, logbooks, diaries, journals, bracketing); and
checks on the utility of findings in responding to the study problem (e.g., evaluation of whether a solution worked).

3.15 Qualitative Findings or Results Standards
In qualitative research papers, findings may or may not include quantified information, depending on the study’s goals, approach
to inquiry, and study characteristics. Note that the heading “Findings” may be used rather than “Results.”

Descriptions of Both the Development of Findings and the Findings Themselves. Describe research findings (e.g., themes,
categories, narratives) and the meaning and understandings that the researchers derived from the data analysis in relation to the
purpose  of  the  study.  Descriptions  of  results  often  include  quotes,  evidence,  or  excerpts  that  demonstrate  the  process  of  data
analysis  and  of  reaching  findings  (e.g.,  thick,  evocative  description;  field  notes;  text  excerpts).  These  should  not  replace  the
description of the findings of the analysis, however. Instead, balance these illustrations with text descriptions that make clear the
meanings drawn from individual quotes or excerpts and how they answer the study question.

Compatibility  With  Study  Design.  Findings  should  be  presented  in  a  manner  that  is  compatible  with  the  study  design.  For
instance, findings of a grounded theory study might be described using categories organized in a hierarchical form and marked
by  discrete  divisions,  whereas  findings  of  an  ethnographic  study  might  be  written  in  a  chronological  narrative  format.  Also,
findings should be written in a style that is coherent with the approach to inquiry used.

Depictions of Findings. Qualitative findings can be presented in various ways. Illustrations (e.g., diagrams, tables, models; see
Chapter 7) may be used to organize and convey findings. Photographs or links to videos can be used as well (see Sections 2.15
and  7.30).  Findings  presented  in  an  artistic  manner  (e.g.,  link  to  a  dramatic  presentation),  however,  should  also  include  the

120

information called for in the reporting standards to support the research presentation and a description that clarifies the analytic
process and meanings drawn from the findings.

3.16 Qualitative Discussion Standards
The purpose of a qualitative Discussion section is to communicate the contributions of the study in relation to the prior literature
and  the  study  goals.  In  this  process,  the  interpretations  of  the  findings  are  described  in  a  way  that  takes  into  account  the
limitations  of  the  study  as  well  as  plausible  alternative  explanations.  The  Discussion  section  conveys  applications  of  your
findings  and  provides  directions  for  future  investigators.  If  you  present  multiple  studies,  discuss  the  findings  in  the  order  in
which they are presented within the paper.

Interpreting the Meaning of Your Findings. Instead of simply restating results, a good Discussion section develops readers’
understanding  of  the  issues  at  hand.  To  do  this,  describe  the  central  contributions  of  your  research  and  their  significance  in
advancing  disciplinary  understandings.  Identifying  similarities  and  differences  from  prior  theories  and  research  findings  will
help in this process. Describe the contributions the findings make (e.g., elaborating on, challenging, or supporting prior research
or theory) and how findings can be best utilized. Reflect on any alternative explanations of the findings to clarify the strengths
and weaknesses of the explanation that you selected. More than one valid or useful set of findings may emerge from a given data
set.  It  is  not  considered  a  drawback  for  there  to  be  more  than  one  possible  interpretation  because  researchers  may  centralize
different processes or perspectives; however, findings should remain grounded in the empirical analysis of the data.

Limitations and Strengths. Include a subsection to identify the strengths and limitations of the study (e.g., consider how the
quality,  source,  or  types  of  data  or  the  analytic  processes  might  support  or  weaken  the  study’s  methodological  integrity,
reliability, or validity). Within this subsection, describe the limits of the scope of generalizability or transferability (e.g., issues
readers should consider when using findings across contexts).

Study  Implications.  Convey  to  readers  how  your  findings  might  be  used  and  their  implications.  In  this  process,  you  might
outline  emerging  research  questions,  theoretical  insights,  new  understandings,  or  methodological  designs  that  advantage  the
conceptualization, implementation, review, or reporting of future studies. In addition, implications for policy, clinical practice,
and advocacy can be communicated to assist readers in implementing your findings.

3.17 Qualitative Meta-Analysis Standards
Qualitative  meta-analyses  (see  Section  1.5)  have  unique  reporting  standards  that  are  available  in  full  on  the  JARS  website
(https://apastyle.apa.org/jars/qual-table-2.pdf). Two features of qualitative meta-analysis reporting highlighted in this section are
reporting on the aggregative process and reporting situatedness.

Reporting on the Aggregative Process. The methodological integrity of the results of meta-analyses rests largely on the extent
to which those carrying out the analysis can detail and defend the choices they made of studies to review and the process they
undertook to weigh and integrate the findings of the studies. Authors of meta-analyses often aggregate qualitative studies from
multiple methodological or theoretical approaches, and they must communicate the approaches of the studies they reviewed as
well  as  their  own  approach  to  secondary  data  analysis.  Qualitative  meta-analysis  involves  the  interpretive  aggregation  of
thematic findings rather than reanalysis of primary data. Forms of qualitative meta-analysis range on a continuum from assessing
the ways findings do or do not replicate each other to arranging interpreted findings into narrative accounts that relate the studies
to one another. Authors of meta-analyses enhance their fidelity to the findings by considering the contradictions and ambiguities
within and across studies.

Reporting Situatedness.  Another  factor  that  distinguishes  qualitative  meta-analyses  from  primary  qualitative  analyses  is  that
they often include an examination of the situatedness of the authors of the primary studies reviewed (e.g., the perspectives of the
primary researchers as well as their social positions and contexts and their studies’ reflection of these perspectives). Situatedness
can be considered in the Findings/Results or Discussion section and may be presented narratively or in tables when simplifying
the presentation of trends. See the online table for complete information on reporting qualitative meta-analyses.

Reporting Standards for Mixed Methods Research

3.18 Basic Expectations for Mixed Methods Research Reporting

Whereas standards for reporting information in the abstract and introduction of a paper are common to all kinds of research (see
Sections  3.3–3.4),  there  are  specific  reporting  standards  for  mixed  methods  research  articles.  The  basic  expectations  for
reporting  mixed  methods  research  are  presented  in  Table  3.3.  Standards  specific  to  quantitative  and  qualitative  research  are
presented in Sections 3.5 to 3.12 and 3.13 to 3.17, respectively.

122

Table 3.3 Mixed Methods Design Reporting Standards (JARS–Mixed)

Title and Title Page

Title

See the JARS–Quant and JARS–Qual Standards (Tables 3.1–3.2).

Guidance for Authors

Refrain from using words that are either qualitative (e.g., “explore,” “understand”) or quantitative (e.g., “determinants,” “correlates”)
because mixed methods stands in the middle between qualitative and quantitative research.
Reference the mixed methods, qualitative methods, and quantitative methods used.

Author Note

See the JARS–Quant and JARS–Qual Standards (Tables 3.1–3.2).

Abstract

See the JARS–Quant and JARS–Qual Standards (Tables 3.1–3.2).
Indicate the mixed methods design, including types of participants or data sources, analytic strategy, main results/findings, and major
implications/significance.

Guidance for Authors

Specify the type of mixed methods design used. See the note on types of designs in the Research Design Overview section of this table.
Consider using one keyword that describes the type of mixed methods design and one that describes the problem addressed.
Describe your approach(es) to inquiry and, if relevant, how intersecting approaches to inquiry are combined when this description will
facilitate the review process and intelligibility of your paper. If your work is not grounded in a specific approach(es) to inquiry or your
approach would be too complicated to explain in the allotted word count, however, it would not be advisable to provide explication on this
point in the abstract.

Introduction

Description of Research Problems/Questions

See the JARS–Quant and JARS–Qual Standards (Tables 3.1–3.2).

Guidance for Authors

This section may convey barriers in the literature that suggest a need for both qualitative and quantitative data.

Guidance for Reviewers

Theory or conceptual framework use in mixed methods varies depending on the specific mixed methods design or procedures used.
Theory may be used inductively or deductively (or both) in mixed methods research.

Study Objectives/Aims/Research Goals

See the JARS–Quant and JARS–Qual Standards (Tables 3.1–3.2).
State three types of research objectives/aims/goals: qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods. Order these goals to reflect the type of
mixed methods design used.
Describe the ways approaches to inquiry were combined, as it illuminates the objectives and mixed methods rationale (e.g., descriptive,
interpretive, feminist, psychoanalytic, postpositivist, critical, post-modern, constructivist, or pragmatic approaches).

Guidance for Reviewers

A mixed methods objective, aim, or goal may not be familiar to reviewers. It describes the results to be obtained from using the mixed
methods design type where “mixing” or integration occurs (e.g., the aim is to explain quantitative survey results with qualitative interviews
in an explanatory sequential design). For instance, the goal of a qualitative phase could be the development of a conceptual model, the
goal of a quantitative phase could be hypothesis testing based upon that model, and the goal of the mixed methods phase could be to
generate integrated support for a theory based upon quantitative and qualitative evidence.

Method

Research Design Overview

See the JARS–Quant and JARS–Qual Standards (Tables 3.1–3.2).
Explain why mixed methods research is appropriate as a methodology given the paper’s goals.
Identify the type of mixed methods design used and define it.
Indicate the qualitative approach to inquiry and the quantitative design used within the mixed methods design type (e.g., ethnography,
randomized experiment).
If multiple approaches to inquiry were combined, describe how this was done and provide a rationale (e.g., descriptive, interpretive, feminist,
psychoanalytic, postpositivist, critical, postmodern, constructivist, or pragmatic approaches), as it illuminates the mixed method in use.
Provide a rationale or justification for the need to collect both qualitative and quantitative data and the added value of integrating the results
(findings) from the two data sets.

Guidance for Reviewers

123

Because mixed methods research is a relatively new methodology, it is helpful to provide a definition of it from a major reference in the
field.
Mixed methods research involves rigorous methods, both qualitative and quantitative. Refer to the qualitative and quantitative standards
for details of rigor.
One of the most widely discussed topics in the mixed methods literature would be research designs. There is not a generic mixed
methods design but rather multiple types of designs. Basic, core designs include convergent design, explanatory sequential design, and
exploratory sequential design. Although the names and types of designs may differ among mixed methods writers, a common
understanding is that the procedures for conducting a mixed methods study may differ from one project to another. Further, these basic
procedures can be expanded by linking mixed methods to other designs (e.g., an intervention or experimental trial mixed methods study),
to theories or standpoints (e.g., a feminist mixed methods study), or to other methodologies (e.g., a participatory action research mixed
methods study).

PARTICIPANTS OR OTHER DATA SOURCES

See the JARS–Quant and JARS–Qual Standards (Tables 3.1–3.2).
When data are collected from multiple sources, clearly identify the sources of qualitative and quantitative data (e.g., participants, text), their
characteristics, and the relationship between the data sets, if there is one (e.g., an embedded design).
State the data sources in the order of procedures used in the design type (e.g., qualitative sources first in an exploratory sequential design
followed by quantitative sources), if a sequenced design is used in the mixed methods study.

Guidance for Authors

Because multiple sources of data are collected, separate descriptions of samples are needed when they differ. A table of qualitative
sources and quantitative sources is helpful. This table could include type of data, when data were collected, and from whom. This table
might also include study aims/research questions for each data source and anticipated outcomes of the study. In mixed methods
research, this table is often called an “implementation matrix.”
Rather than describe data as represented in numbers versus words, it is better to describe sources of data as open-ended information
(e.g., qualitative interviews) and closed-ended information (e.g., quantitative instruments).

RESEARCHER DESCRIPTION

See the JARS–Qual Standards (Table 3.2).

Guidance for Authors

Because mixed methods research includes qualitative research, and reflexivity is often included in qualitative research, we recommend
statements as to how the researchers’ backgrounds influence the research.

Guidance for Reviewers

It is helpful to establish in a publication the researchers’ experiences (or research teams’ experiences) with both qualitative and
quantitative research as a prerequisite for conducting mixed methods research.

Participant Recruitment

PARTICIPANT SAMPLING OR SELECTION

See the JARS–Quant and JARS–Qual Standards (Tables 3.1–3.2).
Describe the qualitative and the quantitative sampling in separate sections.
Relate the order of the sections to the procedures used in the mixed methods design type.

PARTICIPANT RECRUITMENT

See the JARS–Quant and JARS–Qual Standards (Tables 3.1–3.2).
Discuss the recruitment strategy for qualitative and quantitative research separately.

Data Collection

DATA–COLLECTION/IDENTIFICATION PROCEDURES

See the JARS–Quant and JARS–Qual Standards (Tables 3.1–3.2).

RECORDING AND TRANSFORMING THE DATA
See the JARS–Qual Standards (Table 3.2).

Data Analysis

See the JARS–Quant and JARS–Qual Standards (Tables 3.1–3.2).
Devote separate sections to the qualitative data analysis, the quantitative data analysis, and the mixed methods analysis. This mixed
methods analysis consists of ways that the quantitative and qualitative results were “mixed” or integrated according to the type of mixed
methods design used (e.g., merged in a convergent design, connected in explanatory sequential designs and in exploratory sequential
designs).

Validity, Reliability, and Methodological Integrity

See the JARS–Quant and JARS–Qual Standards (Tables 3.1–3.2).
Indicate methodological integrity, quantitative validity and reliability, and mixed methods validity or legitimacy. Further assessments of mixed
methods integrity are also indicated to show the quality of the research process and the inferences drawn from the intersection of the
quantitative and qualitative data.

124

Findings/Results

Findings/Results Subsections

See the JARS–Quant and JARS–Qual Standards (Tables 3.1–3.2).
Indicate how the qualitative and quantitative results were “mixed” or integrated (e.g., discussion; tables of joint displays; graphs; data
transformation in which one form of data is transformed to the other, such as qualitative text, codes, or themes transformed into quantitative
counts or variables).

Guidance for Authors

In mixed methods research, the Findings section typically includes sections on qualitative findings, quantitative results, and mixed
methods results. This section should mirror the type of mixed methods design in terms of sequence (i.e., whether quantitative strand or
qualitative strand comes first; if both are gathered at the same time, either qualitative findings or quantitative results could be presented
first).

Guidance for Reviewers

In mixed methods Results sections (or in the Discussion section to follow), authors are conveying their mixed methods analysis through
“joint display” tables or graphs that array qualitative results (e.g., themes) against the quantitative results (e.g., categorical or continuous
data). This enables researchers to directly compare results or to see how results differ between the quantitative and qualitative strands.

Discussion

Discussion Subsections

See the JARS–Quant and JARS–Qual Standards (Tables 3.1–3.2).

Guidance for Authors

Typically, the Discussion section, like the Method and Findings/Results, mirrors in sequence the procedures used in the type of mixed
methods design. It also reflects on the implications of the integrated findings from across the two methods.

Note.JARS–Qual = qualitative journal article reporting standards; JARS–Quant = quantitative journal article reporting standards.

The inherent assumption of mixed methods research is that the combined qualitative findings and quantitative results lead to
additional insights not gleaned from the qualitative or quantitative findings alone (Creswell, 2015; Greene, 2007; Tashakkori &
Teddlie, 2010). In mixed methods research, the thoughtful integration of qualitative findings and quantitative results leads to a
deeper understanding of the data and enhanced insights. In addition, authors can publish multiple papers from a single mixed
methods study, such as a qualitative study paper, a quantitative study paper, and a mixed methods overview paper.

Incorporating  Both  Quantitative  and  Qualitative  Standards.  The  thoughtful  and  robust  use  of  mixed  methods  requires
researchers to meet the standards of both quantitative and qualitative research methodology in the design, implementation, and
reporting stages. To this end, various mixed methods designs have emerged in the literature (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2017), and
they help inform the procedures used in reporting studies (e.g., convergent design, exploratory sequential design, explanatory
sequential  design).  Typically,  additional  mixed  methods  standards  also  need  to  be  met  along  with  quantitative  and  qualitative
standards. Authors may use their discretion in presenting the sequence of studies but are encouraged to present them in a way
that shows a logical progression of narrative as well as an audit trail (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016).

Reflecting on the Gains From Integration. The standards for mixed methods designs emphasize the need to not only present
both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the research but also describe their integration throughout the sections of the paper.
The  mixed  methods  guidelines  assist  authors  in  describing  the  combination  of  qualitative  and  quantitative  methods.  Authors
should convey not only how the qualitative and quantitative methods contribute to the study goals but also how they enhance
one another to provide a greater depth of understanding or further the research aims.

1The tables and figure in this chapter can also be found on the JARS website (https://apastyle.apa.org/jars) in the guidelines for quantitative, qualitative,
and mixed methods research designs, with different numbering. The JARS website has additional tables for other research designs, including
experimental (e.g., clinical trials), nonexperimental (e.g., observational), and special (e.g., longitudinal) designs for authors to use in their research.

The main objective of scholarly writing is clear communication, which can be achieved by presenting ideas in an orderly and
concise manner. Establishing a tone that conveys the essential points of your work in an interesting way will engage readers and
communicate  your  ideas  effectively.  Precise,  clear  word  choice  and  sentence  structure  also  contribute  to  the  creation  of  a
substantive, impactful work.

In  this  chapter,  we  provide  guidance  on  achieving  the  four  qualities  of  effective  scholarly  writing:  continuity,  flow,
conciseness, and clarity. This is followed by general rules for grammar and usage and suggested strategies for improving your
writing.

Being  able  to  communicate  ideas  clearly  and  succinctly  is  a  recipe  for  success  for  all  writers,  be  they  students  submitting
assignments  to  their  instructor  or  professionals  submitting  manuscripts  to  a  journal.  Effective  scholarly  writing  balances
continuity  and  flow  with  conciseness  and  clarity.  By  implementing  the  techniques  and  principles  described  in Sections 4.1  to
4.11, writers will improve these aspects of their communication and become more effective communicators.

Continuity and Flow

4.1 Importance of Continuity and Flow

Effective writing is characterized by continuity, the logical consistency of expression throughout a written work, and by flow, the
smooth cadence of words and sentences. Inconsistencies, contradictions, omissions, and irrelevancies in your writing style and
presentation of ideas can make your arguments seem less credible. A work that lacks continuity and flow may seem disorganized
or  confusing,  and  details  may  seem  incomplete  or  inconsistent.  Readers  will  better  understand  your  ideas  if  you  aim  for
continuity  in  words,  concepts,  and  thematic  development  from  the  opening  statement  to  the  conclusion.  Explain  relationships
between ideas clearly, and present ideas in a logical order to improve the readability of your paper.

4.2 Transitions
To improve continuity and flow in your writing, check transitions between sentences, paragraphs, and ideas to ensure that the
text is smooth and clear rather than abrupt or disjointed. When editing your writing, use additional transitional devices to make it
less choppy. Text that sounds choppy or disjointed may indicate that you have abandoned an argument or theme prematurely—
instead consider amplifying its discussion.

Punctuation marks contribute to continuity and flow by signaling transitions and demonstrating relationships between ideas.
They also reflect the pauses, inflections, subordination, and pacing normally heard in speech. Use the full range of punctuation.
Neither  overuse  nor  underuse  one  type  of  punctuation,  such  as  commas  or  dashes:  Overuse  may  annoy  readers,  whereas
underuse may cause confusion. Instead, use punctuation to support meaning.

Likewise, transitional words and phrases help maintain the flow of ideas, especially when the material is complex or abstract.
For  example,  using  a  pronoun  that  refers  to  a  noun  in  the  preceding  sentence  not  only  serves  as  a  transition  but  also  avoids

128

repetition. Be sure the referent is obvious. Other transitional words and phrases include the following:

time links (e.g., “then,” “next,” “after,” “while,” “since”)
cause–effect links (e.g., “therefore,” “consequently,” “as a result”)
addition links (e.g., “in addition,” “moreover,” “furthermore,” “similarly”)
contrast links (e.g., “but,” “conversely,” “nevertheless,” “however,” “although”)

Use adverbs judiciously as introductory or transitional words (e.g., adverbs such as “certainly,” “consequently,” “conversely,”
“fortunately,” “importantly,” “interestingly,” “more importantly,” “regrettably,” and “similarly”). Writers often overuse adverbs,
so ask yourself whether the introduction or transition is needed. For example, both “importantly” and “interestingly” can often
be recast to enhance the message of a sentence or simply omitted without a loss of meaning.

4.3 Noun Strings
Noun strings‚  meaning  several  nouns  placed  one  after  another  to  modify  a  final  noun,  can  confuse  readers  and  force  them  to
question how the words relate to one another. Although skillful hyphenation can clarify the relationships between words, often
the  best  option  is  to  untangle  the  string.  One  approach  to  untangling  is  to  move  the  final  noun  earlier  in  the  string  and  show
relationships between the other nouns by using verbs and prepositions. For example, “culturally sensitive qualitative interview
techniques”  can  be  rearranged  to  “culturally  sensitive  techniques  for  qualitative  interviews.”  Consider  the  following,  nearly
uninterpretable noun strings and how each could be better structured:

instructional methods

Conciseness and Clarity

4.4 Importance of Conciseness and Clarity

Say  only  what  needs  to  be  said  in  your  writing:  The  author  who  is  more  concise—that  is,  more  frugal  with  words—writes  a
more readable paper. Authors seeking publication and students completing assignments increase their chances of success when
they write concisely. Likewise, writing that is clear and precise is more accurate and transparent. In combination, conciseness
and clarity in your writing ensure that readers understand your meaning.

Some writers may fear that writing concisely will make their papers too short. However, adding extraneous material or “fluff”
to make your paper longer will dilute its focus and meaning and will not improve your chances of publication or of getting a
favorable grade. If your paper is too short when written concisely, your ideas and themes may need to be further developed to
add substance.

Where possible, tighten language to eliminate wordiness, redundancy (see Section 4.5), evasiveness, overuse of the passive
voice,  circumlocution,  and  clumsy  prose.  Shorten  or  eliminate  overly  detailed  descriptions  of  equipment  or  apparatus,
participants,  or  procedures  (beyond  those  called  for  in  journal  article  reporting  standards;  see  Chapter 3);  elaborations  of  the
obvious;  and  irrelevant  observations  or  asides.  Information  that  would  cause  the  paper  to  be  too  long  and  is  not  essential  to
understanding  the  research—but  would  nonetheless  be  helpful  to  a  subset  of  readers—may  be  placed,  when  appropriate,  in
supplemental materials (see Section 2.15).

Short words and short sentences are easier to comprehend than long ones (see Section 4.6). A long technical term, however,
may be more precise than several short words, and technical terms are inseparable from scientific reporting. However, a paper
with too much jargon or terminology familiar to only a few specialists does not sufficiently contribute to the literature because
its meaning is obfuscated (see Section 4.9). Rather, the technical terms in a paper should be either readily understood by readers
across disciplines or defined for readers who may be unfamiliar with them.

Concise writing must also be clear. Be deliberate in your word choices, making certain that every word means exactly what
you  intend.  For  example,  in  informal  style,  “feel”  broadly  substitutes  for  “think”  or  “believe,”  but  in  academic  style,  such

129

latitude  in  word  choice  is  not  acceptable.  Likewise,  using  a  word  with  multiple  meanings  can  cause  confusion.  For  example,
some writers use the word “significant” to mean “important,” whereas others use “significant” only in the context of statistical
significance testing; ensure that your intended meaning is clear. Choose words and phrases carefully, and specify the intended
meaning if there is potential for ambiguity.

If  you  use  a  word  or  phrase  multiple  times,  do  so  consistently  (e.g.,  do  not  switch  between  “participants  in  the  music
condition” and “participants who heard the music while completing the task”—choose one presentation and use it consistently).
Some writers deliberately use synonyms or near-synonyms to avoid repeating a word or phrase. The intention is commendable,
but  in  practice  the  use  of  synonyms  can  lead  to  imprecision:  By  using  synonyms,  you  may  unintentionally  suggest  a  subtle
difference. Therefore, use synonyms with care.

Word  choice  is  especially  important  when  talking  about  people  who  are  members  of  specific  groups,  such  as  in  a  Method
section. Carefully consider the descriptors you use, making sure they are accurate, consistent with current preferred terminology,
and in line with how the individuals you are writing about describe themselves. In no case should you use biased, pejorative, or
demeaning language (see Chapter 5 for guidelines on using bias-free language).

Strive  for  a  professional  tone  and  professional  language  (see  Sections  4.7–4.9).  Avoid  heavy  alliteration,  rhyming,  poetic
expressions, and clichés. Use metaphors sparingly; although they can help simplify complicated ideas, metaphors can also be
distracting  or  unclear.  Avoid  mixed  metaphors  (e.g.,  “a  theory  representing  one  branch  of  a  growing  body  of  evidence”)  and
words with surplus or unintended meanings (e.g., “outstanding” for “remaining”), which may distract or mislead readers. Use
figurative expressions with restraint and colorful expressions with care; because these expressions can be open to interpretation
and even cultural differences, they generally do not add to understanding for all possible readers. Instead, make direct, logical
comparisons (see Section 4.10) and clearly attribute actions (see Section 4.11).

4.5 Wordiness and Redundancy
Wordiness  can  impede  readers’  understanding  by  forcing  them  to  sort  through  unnecessary  words  to  decipher  your  ideas.
Unconstrained wordiness lapses into embellishment and flowery writing, which are inappropriate in academic style. Consider
the following examples of wordy and concise language:

Wordy

at the present time

for the purpose of

Concise

now

for, to

there were several students who completed

several students completed

Whereas  wordiness  refers  to  using  more  words  than  are  necessary,  redundancy  means  using  multiple  words  with  the  same
meaning. Writers often use redundant language to be emphatic. Instead, use sentence structure to convey emphasis, for example,
by placing the words to be emphasized at the beginning or end of a sentence. When possible and appropriate for the context, use
the active voice (see Section 4.13) to reduce wordiness and redundancy. In the following examples, the highlighted words are
redundant and should be omitted:

they were both alike

a sum total

four different groups saw

were exactly the same as

absolutely essential

has been previously found

small in size

one and the same

in close proximity to

period of time

summarize briefly

the reason is because

4.6 Sentence and Paragraph Length
There is no minimum or maximum sentence length in APA Style. Overuse of short, simple sentences produces choppy prose,
however, and overuse of long, involved sentences results in difficult, sometimes incomprehensible, language. Varied sentence
length  helps  readers  maintain  interest  and  comprehension.  When  involved  concepts  require  long  sentences,  the  components

130

should  proceed  logically.  Avoid  including  multiple  ideas  in  a  single  sentence;  instead,  break  the  sentence  into  shorter  ones.
Direct, declarative sentences with simple, common words are usually best.

Similar cautions apply to paragraph length. Single-sentence paragraphs are abrupt and should be used infrequently. Paragraphs
that are too long (i.e., longer than one double-spaced manuscript page) risk losing readers’ attention. A new paragraph signals a
shift  to  a  new  idea  and  provides  a  pause  for  readers—a  chance  to  assimilate  one  step  in  the  conceptual  development  before
beginning another. Look for a logical place (or places) to break up a long paragraph or reorganize the material.

4.7 Tone
Although scientific writing differs in form and content from creative or literary writing, it need not lack style or be dull. When
writing a scholarly paper, keep in mind that scientific prose and creative or literary writing serve different purposes. Devices that
are  often  used  in  creative  writing—for  example,  setting  up  ambiguity;  inserting  the  unexpected;  omitting  the  expected;  and
suddenly  shifting  the  topic,  tense,  or  person—do  not  support  the  objective  of  clear  communication  in  scientific  writing.
Similarly, devices or embellishments that attract attention to words and sounds instead of to ideas are inappropriate in scientific
writing.

Thus, when describing your research, present the ideas and findings in a direct, straightforward manner, while also aiming for
an  interesting  and  compelling  style—for  example,  by  fully  elaborating  on  an  idea  or  concept  (see Section 4.2),  making  word
choices  that  reflect  your  involvement  with  the  problem  (see  Section  4.4),  and  varying  sentence  and  paragraph  lengths  (see
Section 4.6). Use language that conveys professionalism and formality (see Section 4.8). For example, scientific writing often
contrasts  the  positions  of  different  researchers,  and  these  differences  should  be  presented  in  a  professional,  noncombative
manner: Stating “Gerard (2019) did not address” is acceptable, whereas “Gerard (2019) completely overlooked” is not.

One way to achieve the right tone is to imagine a specific reader you intend to reach and write in a way that will inform and
persuade that individual. For example, your reader might be a researcher in a related field who is trying to keep abreast of the
literature  but  is  not  familiar  with  the  jargon  or  insider  perspectives  of  your  field.  What  would  facilitate  this  reader’s
understanding of and appreciation for the importance of your work?

4.8 Contractions and Colloquialisms
Avoid  using  contractions  and  colloquialisms,  which  detract  from  a  professional  tone  in  scholarly  writing.  Contractions—
shortened  forms  of  one  or  two  words  in  which  an  apostrophe  is  used  in  place  of  missing  letters—generally  do  not  appear  in
scholarly writing because they convey an informal tone. To avoid contractions and improve your writing, evaluate words with
apostrophes carefully. Except for cases noted, rewrite a word like “can’t” into “cannot.” Use apostrophes to indicate possession
(e.g., “the student’s work”), but remember that possessive pronouns do not include apostrophes (e.g., write “its purpose was” not
“it’s  purpose  was”).  However,  contractions  can  be  appropriately  used  in  some  circumstances,  such  as  in  reproducing  a  direct
quotation that contains a contraction (e.g., when quoting a research participant, do not change a participant’s use of “let’s go” to
“let us go”), referring to a contraction as a linguistic example (e.g., when discussing confusion of “who’s” with “whose”), or
referring to an idiom or common saying that contains a contraction (e.g., “you can’t take it with you”).

Likewise,  avoid  colloquialisms,  which  are  informal  expressions  used  in  everyday  speech  and  writing  (e.g.,  “to  write  up”
instead of “to report,” “gonna” instead of “going to”). These expressions often diffuse meaning, as in the case of approximations
of quantity; “quite a large part,” “practically all,” and “very few” are interpreted differently by different readers or in different
contexts. Approximations weaken statements, especially those describing empirical observations. Instead, use precise, scholarly
language.

4.9 Jargon
Jargon is specialized terminology that is unfamiliar to those outside a specific group. Overuse of jargon, even in papers in which
that  vocabulary  is  relevant,  hinders  comprehension.  Jargon  also  may  be  euphemistic  if  substituted  for  a  familiar  term  (e.g.,
“period of economic adjustment” instead of “recession”), and you should avoid using jargon in this way. Bureaucratic jargon has
had  the  greatest  publicity,  but  academic  or  scientific  jargon  may  also  grate  on  readers,  encumber  communication,  and  waste
space. Ensure that the language you use allows readers to understand your writing even if they are not experts in your field, and
define on first use any specialized terms that are key to your topic.

4.10 Logical Comparisons

131

Ensure that the comparisons you make are expressed clearly and logically. Ambiguous or illogical comparisons result from the
omission of key words or from nonparallel structure (see Section 4.24).  Consider,  for  example,  “Twelve-year-olds  were  more
likely to play with age peers than 6-year-olds.” Does this sentence mean that 12-year-olds were more likely than 6-year-olds to
play with age peers? Or does it mean that 12-year-olds were more likely to play with age peers and less likely to play with 6-
year-olds?  Ambiguity  occurs  when  parallelism  is  overlooked  for  the  sake  of  brevity,  as  in  “The  responses  of  transgender
participants were more positive than cisgender participants.” One correct way to write this sentence would be “The responses of
transgender  participants  were  more  positive  than  those  of  cisgender  participants.”  Thoughtful  attention  to  good  sentence
structure and word choice reduces the chance of this kind of ambiguity.

4.11 Anthropomorphism
Do not attribute human characteristics to animals or to inanimate sources—doing so is called anthropomorphism.

Correct

Incorrect

Rationale

Pairs of rats (cage mates) were
allowed to forage together.

Rat couples (cage mates) were
allowed to forage together.

“Rat couples” implies a misleading parallel between human
romantic couples and pairs of rats.

The theory addresses

The theory concludes

A theory might address, indicate, or present, but it is the
researchers (not the theory itself) who conclude.

Pair active verbs with human actors (e.g., write “we extrapolated the rate of change” rather than “the study extrapolated the rate
of change”). However, many acceptable constructions in widespread use do not constitute anthropomorphism because they do
not impede understanding or mislead readers. When describing the content of different sections of a paper, you may write, for
example, “this section addresses” or “the chapter focuses on” as well as “in this section we address” or “in this chapter, we focus
on” (see Section 6.3 for comma use with introductory phrases). Similarly, when describing the results of a study, you may write
“the results suggest,” “the data provide,” “the research contributes,” “the study found,” and so forth.

Determining  what  constitutes  anthropomorphism  can  be  challenging,  and  even  distinguished  scholars  may  disagree.  In
ambiguous cases, we recommend that authors keep the principle of clear communication at the forefront of their word choice
and sentence structure.

Grammar and Usage

Incorrect  grammar  and  careless  construction  of  sentences  distract  readers,  introduce  ambiguity,  and  impede  clear
communication. The examples in this section represent common grammar and usage errors that often appear in papers submitted
to journal editors and academic instructors.

Verbs

4.12 Verb Tense

Verbs are vigorous, direct communicators. The past tense is appropriate when expressing an action or a condition that occurred
at  a  specific,  definite  time  in  the  past,  such  as  when  discussing  another  researcher’s  work.  The  present  perfect  tense  is
appropriate to express a past action or condition that did not occur at a specific, definite time or to describe an action beginning
in the past and continuing to the present.

Use verb tenses consistently, and stay within the chosen tense to ensure smooth expression. Sudden, unnecessary shifts in verb
tense in the same paragraph or in adjacent paragraphs may confuse readers. Use the verb tenses shown in Table 4.1  to  report
information in various parts of the paper.

4.13 Active and Passive Voice
Voice describes the relationship between a verb and the subject and object associated with it. In the active voice, the subject of a
sentence  is  presented  first,  followed  by  the  verb  and  then  the  object  of  the  verb  (e.g.,  “students  completed  surveys”).  In  the
passive voice, the object of the verb is presented first, followed by the verb (usually a form of “to be” + past participle + the
word “by”) and then the subject last (e.g., “surveys were completed by students”); sometimes, the subject is omitted altogether,
resulting in confusion about who is performing the action.

Choose voice carefully. Both the active and passive voices are permitted in APA Style, but many writers overuse the passive
voice. Use the active voice as much as possible to create direct, clear, and concise sentences. For example, use the active voice
to describe the actions of participants and others involved in your study (see Section 5.6), as in “the patients took the medication
orally,” not “the medication was taken orally by the patients.”

The passive voice is acceptable in expository writing when focusing on the object or recipient of the action rather than on the
actor.  For  example,  a  description  of  the  experimental  setup  in  the  Method  section  might  read,  “the  speakers  were  attached  to
either side of the chair,” which appropriately emphasizes the placement of the speakers, not who placed them. Similarly, “the
tests were gathered promptly” emphasizes the importance of the tests and their timely collection. When it is important to know
who performed the action, use the active voice.

4.14 Mood
Mood refers to the form of a verb authors use to express their attitude toward what they are saying (e.g., whether they believe
what they are saying or just wish it were true). Use the indicative mood to make factual statements (e.g., “we addressed,” “the
findings demonstrate”). Use the subjunctive mood only to describe conditions that are contrary to fact or improbable; do not use
the subjunctive to describe simple conditions or contingencies.

Correct

Incorrect

Rationale

If the campus were larger, we would have
had access to more participants.

If the campus was larger, we would have
had access to more participants.

The campus is not in fact larger; the writer is
only wishing that this were so.

Use the word “would” with care. “Would” can be used in the indicative mood to mean “habitually,” as in “The child would walk
about the classroom,” or in the conditional mood to express a condition of action, as in “We would sign the letter if we could.”
Do not use “would” to hedge; for example, change “it would appear that” to “it appears that.”

4.15 Subject and Verb Agreement
A verb must agree in number (i.e., singular or plural; see Section 6.11) with its subject, regardless of intervening phrases such as
“together with,” “including,” “plus,” and “as well as.”

Correct: The percentage of correct responses, as well as the speed of the responses, increases with practice.
Incorrect: The percentage of correct responses, as well as the speed of the responses, increase with practice.

133

Collective Nouns. Collective nouns (e.g., “series,” “set,” “faculty,” “pair,” “social media”) can refer to several individuals or to
a single unit. If the action of the verb applies to the group as a whole, treat the noun as singular and use a singular verb. If the
action of the verb applies to members of the group as individuals, treat the noun as plural and use a plural verb. The context (i.e.,
your emphasis) determines whether the action applies to the group or to individuals.

Singular in context: The number of people in the state is growing.

A pair of animals was in each cage.

Plural in context: A number of people are watching.

A pair of animals were then yoked.

Use of “None.” The subject pronoun “none” can be singular or plural. When the noun that follows it is singular, use a singular
verb; when the noun is plural, use a plural verb.

Singular in context: None of the information was correct.
Plural in context: None of the children were finished in the time allotted.

Compound Subjects Joined by “Or” or “Nor.” When a compound subject is composed of a singular and a plural noun joined
by “or” or “nor,” the verb agrees with the noun that is closer to the verb.

Correct: Neither the participants nor the confederate was in the room.
Neither the confederate nor the participants were in the room.

Incorrect: Neither the participants nor the confederate were in the room.

Pronouns

4.16 First- Versus Third-Person Pronouns

Pronouns replace nouns, and each pronoun should refer clearly to its antecedent. To avoid ambiguity in attribution, use the first
person rather than the third person when describing the work you did as part of your research and when expressing your own
views. If you are writing a paper by yourself, use the pronoun “I”; do not use the pronoun “we” to refer to yourself if you do not
have coauthors (see also Section 4.17). If you are writing a paper with coauthors, use the pronoun “we.” Do not refer to yourself
or your coauthors in the third person as “the author(s)” or “the researcher(s).”

However,  use  the  third  person  to  refer  to  the  specific  contribution  of  a  particular  coauthor  within  a  paper  with  multiple

authors. In the following example, Sonia J. Cousteau is one of the authors of the paper:

We assessed children’s language abilities. Sonia J. Cousteau, who is a speech-language pathologist, trained all testers.

Keep in mind that if you refer to coauthors by name in the text of your manuscript, you may need to mark out their names each
time they appear if your paper is to undergo masked review (see Section 12.7).

4.17 Editorial “We”
Do not use “we” to refer to people in general, as in “We live on the same planet, but we rarely truly understand each other”; this
use is called the editorial “we.” It is especially important to avoid the editorial “we” in multiauthored papers because readers
may  wonder  whether  you  are  referring  to  all  people,  members  of  your  professional  group(s),  or  yourself  and  your  coauthors.
Substitute a more specific noun or clarify your usage.

Correct: Psychological researchers typically study decision making in a laboratory setting.

Incorrect: We typically study decision making in a laboratory setting.

Some  alternatives  to  “we”  are  “people,”  “humans,”  “researchers,”  “psychologists,”  “nurses,”  and  so  on.  However,  “we” is  an
appropriate and useful referent once a specific subject has been established.

Correct: As nurses, we tend to rely on . . .
Incorrect: We tend to rely on . . .

134

4.18 Singular “They”
Writers should always use the singular “they” to refer to a person who uses “they” as their pronoun (see Section 5.5 for more on
gender  and  pronoun  usage).  Also  use  “they” as  a  generic  third-person  singular  pronoun  to  refer  to  a  person  whose  gender  is
unknown  or  irrelevant  to  the  context  of  the  usage.  Although  usage  of  the  singular  “they”  was  once  discouraged  in  academic
writing,  many  advocacy  groups  and  publishers  have  accepted  and  endorsed  it,  including  Merriam-Webster’s  Dictionary
(Merriam-Webster,  n.d.-b).  The  use  of  the  singular  “they”  is  inclusive  of  all  people,  helps  writers  avoid  making  assumptions
about gender, and is part of APA Style.

When using the singular “they,” use the forms “they,” “them,” “their,” “theirs,” and “themselves.” The variant “themself” is
also  acceptable  because  the  referent  is  clearly  singular,  although  “themselves”  is  currently  the  more  common  usage.  The
following are examples of correct usage of the singular “they.”

Each participant turned in their questionnaire.

Jamie shared their experiences as a genderqueer person.

A child should learn to play by themselves [or themself] as well as with friends.

Rowan, a transgender person, helped themselves [or themself] to the free coffee.

Do not use “he” or “she” alone as a generic third-person pronoun. Use “he or she” and “she or he” sparingly, and ensure that
these pronouns match the pronouns of the people being described; if you do not know the pronouns used by the people being
described, use “they” instead or rewrite the sentence. Do not use the combination forms “(s)he” and “s/he” or alternate “he” and
“she”  (unless  you  know  that  a  person  uses  these  forms);  these  choices  may  have  unintentional  implications.  For  further
discussion of gender and pronoun usage, see Section 5.5.

Keep in mind that there are typically many possible ways to write a sentence. If the singular “they” as a generic third-person

pronoun seems awkward or distracting, try one of the following strategies to rewrite the sentence.

4.19 Pronouns for People and Animals (“Who” vs. “That”)
Relative  pronouns  introduce  subordinate  clauses  linked  to  nouns.  Use  the  relative  pronoun  “who”  for  human  beings;  use  the
relative pronoun “that” or “which” for nonhuman animals (e.g., rats, chimpanzees) and for inanimate objects.

Correct: The students who completed the task

Correct: The instructions that were included
Incorrect: The students that completed the task

Use  neuter  pronouns  to  refer  to  animals  (e.g.,  “the  dog  .  .  .  it”).  However,  it  is  acceptable  to  use  gendered
pronouns if the animal has been named and its sex is known, as in the following example:

The  chimps  were  tested  daily.  Sheba  was  tested  unrestrained  in  an  open  testing  area,  which  was  her  usual  context  for  training  and
testing.

4.20 Pronouns as Subjects and Objects (“Who” vs. “Whom”)

135

Relative pronouns can be subjects or objects of verbs or prepositions. Use “who” as the subject of a verb and “whom” as  the
object  of  a  verb  or  a  preposition.  You  can  determine  whether  a  pronoun  is  the  subject  or  object  of  a  verb  by  turning  the
subordinate  clause  around  and  substituting  a  personal  pronoun.  If  you  can  substitute  “he,”  “she,”  or  “they,”  then  “who”  is
correct. In the following examples, “who” and its replacement personal pronoun are highlighted to show the substitutions. The
sentence with the substitution is a way to verify whether the original sentence is correct.

Likewise, if you can substitute “him,” “her,” or “them,” then “whom” is correct.

The participants whom passed the exam were given course
credit.

Them passed the exam and were given course credit.

4.21 Pronouns in Restrictive and Nonrestrictive Clauses (“That” vs. “Which”)
Relative  pronouns  (e.g.,  “who,”  “whom,”  “that,”  “which”)  introduce  an  element  that  is  subordinate  to  the  main  clause  of  the
sentence, and that subordinate clause may be either restrictive or nonrestrictive.

Restrictive clauses—also called “that” clauses—are essential to the meaning of the sentence. Restrictive clauses are not set off

with commas.

Therapist self-disclosure that conflicts with the patient’s story might hinder the therapeutic process.

In the example, only self-disclosure that conflicts with the patient’s story, not all self-disclosure, might hinder the therapeutic
process.

Nonrestrictive  clauses—also  called  “which”  clauses—add  further  information  to  the  sentence  but  are  not  essential  to  its

meaning. Nonrestrictive clauses are set off with commas.

All interviews were conducted at participants’ offices, which provided suitable privacy to secure participants’ anonymity.

In the example, all interviews were conducted at the offices, and all offices provided suitable privacy.

Although  some  writers  use  “which”  for  both  restrictive  and  nonrestrictive  clauses,  APA  Style  reserves  “which”  for
nonrestrictive  clauses  and  “that”  for  restrictive  clauses.  Consistent  use  of  “that”  for  restrictive  clauses  and  “which”  for
nonrestrictive clauses will help make your writing clear and precise.

Sentence Construction

4.22 Subordinate Conjunctions

Subordinate conjunctions (e.g., “since,” “while,” “although,” “because,” “whereas”), like relative pronouns (see Sections 4.19–
4.21),  introduce  subordinate  clauses.  Select  these  conjunctions  with  care;  interchanging  conjunctions  with  more  than  one
meaning  may  reduce  the  precision  of  your  writing.  Although  some  writers  use  “while”  and  “since”  when  they  do  not  refer
strictly to time, restricting your use of “while” and “since” to their temporal meanings can be helpful to readers.

“While” Versus “Although,” “Despite,” “And,” or “But.” Use “while” to link events occurring simultaneously.

Individual goal striving in late adulthood may enrich life while reducing stagnation and boredom.

Otherwise, use “although,” “despite,” “and,” or “but” in place of “while.”

136

Precise: Although goal progress predicted well-being for all genders, the associations tended to be stronger for women.

Goal progress predicted well-being for all genders, but the associations tended to be stronger for women.

Imprecise: While goal progress predicted well-being for all genders, the associations tended to be stronger for women.

“Since” Versus “Because.” In cases where the meaning of “since” is ambiguous (it could be either “from a time in the past” or
“because”), replace “since” with “because.” If the meaning is not ambiguous, it is acceptable to use either “since” or “because”
to mean “because.”

Precise: Participants were leaving because the light turned green.

Imprecise: Participants were leaving since the light turned green.

4.23 Misplaced and Dangling Modifiers
An adjective or an adverb, whether a single word or a phrase, must clearly refer to the word that it modifies. Having modifiers
without clear referents can make it hard for readers to follow the logic of your sentence.

Misplaced Modifiers. Because of their placement in a sentence, misplaced modifiers ambiguously or illogically modify a word.
Eliminate misplaced modifiers by placing an adjective or an adverb as close as possible to the word it modifies.

Correct

Incorrect

Rationale

Using this procedure, the investigator
tested the participants.

The investigator tested the
participants using this procedure.

The incorrect sentence is unclear about whether the
investigator or the participants used this procedure.

The investigator tested the participants
who were using the procedure.

On the basis of this assumption, we
developed a model.

Based on this assumption, we
developed a model.

The incorrect construction says, “we are based on this
assumption.”

Based on this assumption, the model
. . .

Many writers misplace the word “only.” Place “only” next to the word or phrase it modifies.

Correct

Incorrect

Rationale

These data provide only a partial answer.

These data only provide a partial answer.

The answer is partial, not the providing of it.

Squinting  modifiers  are  a  type  of  misplaced  modifier.  Because  of  their  ambiguous  placement,  they  make  it  difficult  to  tell
whether the modifier refers to the phrase before or after the modifier.

Correct

Incorrect

Rationale

My comprehension is improved when I
read slowly.

Reading books slowly improves my
comprehension.

It is unclear whether the reading or the
improvement is slow.

Dangling Modifiers. Dangling modifiers have no referent in the sentence. Many of these result from the use of the passive voice
(see Section 4.13). You can avoid many dangling modifiers by writing in the active voice.

Correct

Incorrect

Using this procedure, I tested the participants.

The participants were tested using this procedure.

Rationale

I, not the participants,
used the procedure.

Armitage and Martinez (2017) found that the treatment
group performed better, a result congruent with those of
other studies.

Congruent with other studies, Armitage and
Martinez (2017) found that the treatment group
performed better.

The result, not Armitage
and Martinez, is
congruent.

4.24 Parallel Construction

137

To  enhance  readers’  understanding,  present  parallel  ideas  in  parallel  or  coordinate  form.  Use  parallel  structure  in  compound
sentences, series and lists (see Sections 6.49–6.52), and table stubs (see Section 7.12).

Repetition  of  Parallel  Elements.  Ensure  that  all  elements  of  the  parallelism  are  present  before  and  after  the  coordinating
conjunction (e.g., “and,” “but,” “or,” “nor”). For example, if the first part of the clause is introduced by “that,” the second part of
the clause should be as well. When a clause has two parts (and not three or more), do not use a comma or semicolon before the
conjunction.

Correct: Ford (2020) found that homework is positively related to achievement and that the association is stronger in middle and high
school than in elementary school.

Incorrect: Ford (2020) found that homework is positively related to achievement, and that the association is stronger in middle and high
school than in elementary school.

Coordinating Conjunctions Used in Pairs. With coordinating conjunctions used in pairs (“between . . . and,” “both . . . and,”
“neither . . . nor,” “either . . . or,” “not only . . . but also”), place the first conjunction immediately before the first part of the
parallelism.

“Between” and “And.”

Correct: We recorded the difference between the performance of participants who completed the first task and the performance of those
who completed the second task.

Incorrect: We recorded the difference between the performance of participants who completed the first task and the second task.

Correct: between 2.5 and 4.0 years old
Incorrect: between 2.5–4.0 years old

“Both” and “And.”

Correct: The names were difficult both to pronounce and to spell.

Incorrect: The names were difficult both to pronounce as well as to spell.

Never use “both” with “as well as”: The resulting construction is redundant.

“Neither” and “Nor”; “Either” and “Or.”

Correct: Neither the responses to the auditory stimuli nor the responses to the tactile stimuli were repeated.
Incorrect: Neither the responses to the auditory stimuli nor to the tactile stimuli were repeated.

Correct: The respondents either gave the worst answer or gave the best answer.
Correct: The respondents gave either the worst answer or the best answer.

Incorrect: The respondents either gave the worst answer or the best answer.

“Not Only” and “But Also.”

Correct: It is surprising not only that pencil-and-paper scores predicted this result but also that all other predictors were less accurate.
Incorrect: It is not only surprising that pencil-and-paper scores predicted this result but also that all other predictors were less accurate.

Elements in a Series. Elements in a series should also be parallel in form.

Correct: The  participants  were  told  to make themselves  comfortable,  to read the  instructions,  and  to ask  about  anything  they  did  not
understand.

Incorrect: The participants were told to make themselves comfortable, to read the instructions, and that they should ask about anything
they did not understand.

Strategies to Improve Your Writing

Good  writing  is  a  skill  learned  through  practice.  In  this  section,  we  recommend  strategies  to  improve  your  writing.  These
strategies  can  aid  both  professionals  preparing  manuscripts  for  journal  submission  and  students  preparing  papers  for  course
submission.

138

4.25 Reading to Learn Through Example
Reading  is  one  of  the  most  effective  practices  for  authors  to  improve  their  writing  because  it  enables  them  to  learn  through
example.  For  instance,  a  student  tasked  with  writing  a  literature  review  would  benefit  from  reading  other  literature  reviews
(including  the  literature  review  sections  of  longer  works)  to  see  the  various  ways  in  which  information  can  be  organized  and
discussed. Likewise, an author who needs to present complex statistical information in a table would benefit from seeing how
other authors have organized similar information in their tables. Careful reading in your chosen area of study will help you learn
about not only new developments in the field but also ways to effectively convey information on the page.

4.26 Writing From an Outline
Writing from an outline ensures that the flow of your paper reflects the logic of your research or ideas. Creating and using an
outline  helps  you  identify  main  ideas,  define  subordinate  ideas,  focus  your  writing,  avoid  tangential  excursions,  and  find
omissions. In the outline, you can also designate headings and subheadings you will use in your paper (see Sections 2.26–2.27
for more on principles of organization and levels of heading). Outlines can take many forms, including the traditional format
with Roman numeral headings or a concept map.

4.27 Rereading the Draft
Rereading your own work after setting it aside for a few hours or days allows you to look at it from a fresh perspective. Taking
the further step of reading your paper aloud may reveal faults that you previously overlooked and may help strengthen the tone
and style of your writing. You can also try reading the sections of your paper in reverse order—from the conclusion back to the
introduction—to ensure that you have set up arguments appropriately. Budget ample time when writing to allow yourself to take
advantage of these strategies.

4.28 Seeking Help From Colleagues
After  you  have  reread  your  draft,  give  a  revised  copy  to  a  colleague—preferably  a  person  who  has  published  in  or  studied  a
related field but who is not familiar with your own work—for a critical review. Even better, get critiques from two colleagues,
and you will have a trial run of a journal’s review process. Students are also encouraged to solicit feedback from their instructor
and peers.

4.29 Working With Copyeditors and Writing Centers
Some writers, particularly new writers and those writing in a nonnative language, may benefit from extra help with their writing.
They might hire a copyeditor to review and proofread their paper or visit a tutor at a university writing center. A copyeditor or
writing center tutor can assist with idiomatic language use, organization, and other areas. We highly recommend use of these
services for authors who consistently face obstacles in getting their work published or students who would like to attain more
success in the classroom. Students should check the academic integrity policies of their institution to determine what kinds of
assistance are acceptable.

4.30 Revising a Paper
Revising a draft into a polished paper takes time and effort. Writers should develop a revision plan. It is best to start with the big
picture and work down to the details. Consider the following broad questions when reviewing your paper:

Is the central point or thesis of your paper clear? Do the arguments follow logically from the thesis?

Is the information well organized?

For  students,  does  the  draft  meet  the  parameters  of  the  assignment?  If  there  is  a  rubric  for  the  assignment,  does  the  paper
address each element of the rubric?

For authors seeking publication, does the draft fit the journal style and formatting requirements (see Sections 12.2–12.4)?

At  the  detail  level,  check  sentences  for  correct  grammar  and  usage  (see  Sections  4.12–4.24).  Also  check  for  spelling  and
grammar errors using the automatic spell-check and grammar-check functions of your word-processing program. Although an
electronic spell-check cannot take the place of careful proofreading (because words spelled correctly may be used incorrectly), it
will lessen the chances that typographical errors make their way into the published article or the submitted assignment. APA uses

139

Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary and the APA Dictionary of Psychology as its authorities on spelling (for additional information on
spelling, see Sections 6.11–6.12). Grammar-check functions are useful for identifying problematic sentence structure. Keep in
mind, however, that grammar is complex and therefore grammar-checkers are not infallible.

Although  the  Publication  Manual  addresses  many  aspects  of  grammar  and  usage,  it  focuses  on  the  areas  that  are  the  most
problematic for writers of scholarly work. For grammatical questions not addressed in the Publication Manual, consult a trusted
grammar reference.

B IA S- FR EE LA N GU A GE GU ID ELIN ES

Authors must strive to use language that is free of bias, meaning the implied or irrelevant evaluation of the group or groups they
are writing about. As an organization, APA is committed to both the advancement of science and the fair treatment of individuals
and  groups.  These  principles  require  that  authors  and  students  who  use  APA  Style  avoid  perpetuating  demeaning  attitudes  in
their writing. It is unacceptable to use constructions that might imply prejudicial beliefs or perpetuate biased assumptions against
persons  on  the  basis  of  age,  disability,  gender,  participation  in  research,  racial  or  ethnic  identity,  sexual  orientation,
socioeconomic status, or some combination of these or other personal factors (e.g., marital status, immigration status, religion).
Instead, authors should use affirming and inclusive language.

Long-standing  cultural  practice  can  exert  a  powerful  influence  over  even  the  most  conscientious  writer.  Just  as  you  have
learned to check what you write for spelling, grammar, and wordiness, practice rereading your work for preconceptions about
groups of people. Ask people from the groups about which you are writing to read and comment on your material or consult
self-advocacy groups to determine appropriate terminology. If you work directly with participants, ask them what terms they use
to describe themselves. Language changes over time, and it is important to use the terms that individuals and/or communities use
to describe themselves, their experiences, and their practices.

Some attempts to follow the guidelines in this chapter may result in wordiness or clumsy prose. As always, good judgment is
required—these are not rigid rules. If your writing reflects respect for your participants and your readers, and if you write with
appropriate  specificity  and  precision,  you  contribute  to  the  goal  of  accurate,  unbiased  communication.  This  chapter  contains
general  guidelines  for  writing  without  bias  that  apply  across  a  range  of  issues  and  additional  guidelines  that  address  specific
topics, including age, disability, gender, participation in research, race and ethnicity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status,

General Guidelines for Reducing Bias

5.1 Describe at the Appropriate Level of Specificity

Precision is essential in scholarly writing; when you refer to a person or persons, choose words that are accurate, clear, and free
from  bias  or  prejudicial  connotations.  Bias,  like  inaccurate  or  unclear  language,  can  be  a  form  of  imprecision.  For  example,
using “man” to refer to all human beings is not as accurate or inclusive as using the terms “individuals,” “people,” or “persons.”

Focus on Relevant Characteristics. Be mindful to describe only relevant characteristics. Although it is possible to describe a
person’s  age,  disability,  gender  identity,  participation  in  research,  racial  and  ethnic  identity,  sexual  orientation,  socioeconomic
status, or other characteristic without bias, it is not always necessary to include all of this information in your report (for a more
detailed discussion of participant characteristics to report in quantitative and qualitative studies, refer to Sections 3.6 and 3.14,
respectively). For example, you would be unlikely to mention participants’ sexual orientation in a study of cognition because
sexual orientation is not relevant to cognition; however, you would likely mention participants’ gender in a study of stereotype
threat  because  gender  is  relevant  to  the  examination  of  stereotype  threat.  Furthermore,  there  may  be  multiple  relevant
characteristics  to  discuss;  when  this  is  the  case,  address  the  ways  in  which  the  characteristics  intersect,  as  appropriate  (see
Section 5.10).

143

Acknowledge Relevant Differences That Do Exist. Part of writing without bias is not only recognizing that differences should
be mentioned only when relevant but also acknowledging relevant differences when they do exist. Evaluate the meaning of the
word “difference” carefully in relation to the target population, not the dominant group. For example, a researcher who wants to
generalize  the  study  results  to  people  overall,  or  students  overall,  and  so  forth,  should  assess  and  report  whether  the  sample
studied is different from the target population and, if so, describe how it is different.

Be Appropriately Specific.  Once  you  have  determined  which  characteristics  to  describe,  choose  terms  that  are  appropriately
specific,  which  will  depend  on  the  research  question  and  the  present  state  of  knowledge  in  the  field.  Do  not  mention
characteristics gratuitously; however, when in doubt, be more specific rather than less because it is easier to aggregate data than
to  disaggregate  them.  Consider  the  appropriate  level  of  specificity  early  in  the  research  process—such  as  when  designing  the
study—because  it  may  not  be  possible  to  gather  more  data  once  the  study  is  underway  or  finished.  Using  specific  terms
improves readers’ ability to understand the generalizability of your findings and other researchers’ ability to use your data in a
meta-analysis or replication.

Examples  of  Specificity  by  Topic. Next,  we  present  examples  of  specific  language  for  the  topics  covered  in  these  bias-free
language  guidelines;  again,  the  proper  choice  will  depend  on  the  situation,  and  these  examples  represent  just  some  of  the
possible options.

When  writing  about  age,  exact  ages  or  age  ranges  (e.g.,  15–18  years  old,  65–80  years  old)  are  more  specific  than  broad
categories (e.g., under 18 years old, over 65 years old; see Section 5.3). Also include the age mean and median in addition to
the range of ages to increase the specificity of the reporting.

When writing about disability, names of conditions (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease) are more specific than categories of conditions
(e.g., types of dementia) or general references such as “people with disabilities” (see Section 5.4).

When  writing  about  gender  identity,  descriptors  with  modifiers  (e.g.,  cisgender  women,  transgender  women)  are  more
specific than descriptors without modifiers (e.g., women) or general nongendered terms (e.g., people, individuals; see Section
5.5 for how to differentiate between gender and sex).

When  writing  about  people  who  took  part  in  research,  terms  that  indicate  the  context  of  the  research  (e.g.,  patients,
participants, clients) are more specific than general terms (e.g., people, children, women; see Section 5.6).

When writing about racial or ethnic groups, the nation or region of origin (e.g., Chinese Americans, Mexican Americans) is
more specific than a generalized origin (e.g., Asian Americans, Latin Americans; see Section 5.7).

When writing about sexual orientation, the names of people’s orientations (e.g., lesbians, gay men, bisexual people, straight
people) are more specific than broad group labels (e.g., gay; see Section 5.8).

When writing about socioeconomic status, income ranges or specific designations (e.g., below the federal poverty threshold
for a family of four) are more specific than general labels (e.g., low income; see Section 5.9).

5.2 Be Sensitive to Labels
Respect  the  language  people  use  to  describe  themselves;  that  is,  call  people  what  they  call  themselves.  Accept  that  language
changes  with  time  and  that  individuals  within  groups  sometimes  disagree  about  the  designations  they  use.  Make  an  effort  to
determine what is appropriate for your study or paper, particularly when these designations are debated within groups. You may
need to ask your participants which designations they use and/or consult self-advocacy groups that represent these communities
to  research  the  issue  if  you  are  not  working  directly  with  participants.  However,  note  that  some  individuals  may  use  slurs  or
stigmatizing  language  to  refer  to  themselves;  researchers  should  use  extreme  caution  before  repeating  this  language  because
doing so can propagate that stigma (see Sections 5.3–5.4 for more on the use of stigmatizing language with regard to age and
disability, respectively).

Acknowledge People’s Humanity.  Choose  labels  with  sensitivity,  ensuring  that  the  individuality  and  humanity  of  people  are
respected. Avoid using adjectives as nouns to label people (e.g., “the gays,” “the poor”) or labels that equate people with their
condition  (e.g.,  “amnesiacs,”  “schizophrenics,”  “the  learning  disabled,”  “drug  users”).  Instead,  use  adjectival  forms  (e.g.,  gay
men, older adults) or nouns with descriptive phrases (e.g., people living in poverty, people with learning disabilities, people who
use  drugs).  Some  groups  (e.g.,  the  Deaf)  have  chosen  to  use  a  capitalized  label  to  identify  and  promote  a  sense  of  unity  and
community (Solomon, 2012); use the label that the community uses, even when that label is adjectival (note, however, that not

144

everyone who has hearing loss identifies as Deaf). In particular, the use of labels where disability is concerned is evolving, and
people  may  disagree  about  the  preferred  approach.  When  writing  about  disability,  person-first  language  (e.g.,  “a  person  with
paraplegia” rather than “a paraplegic”), identity-first language (e.g., “an autistic person” rather than “a person with autism”), or
both may be acceptable depending on the group you are writing about (see Section 5.4).

Provide  Operational  Definitions  and  Labels.  If  you  provide  operational  definitions  of  groups  early  in  your  paper  (e.g.,
“participants scoring a minimum of X on the Y scale constituted the high verbal group, and those scoring below X constituted
the low verbal group”), the best practice is to describe participants thereafter in terms of the measures used to classify them (e.g.,
“the contrast for the high verbal group was statistically significant”), provided the terms are not inappropriate. A pejorative label
should  not  be  used  in  any  form.  Abbreviations  or  series  labels  for  groups  usually  sacrifice  clarity  and  may  be  problematic:
“LDs”  or  “LD  group”  to  describe  people  with  specific  learning  difficulties  is  problematic;  “HVAs”  for  “high  verbal  ability
group” is difficult to decipher. “Group A” is not problematic, but it is also not descriptive. Instead, ensure that operational group
labels are clear and appropriate (e.g., “group with dysgraphia”).

Avoid False Hierarchies. Compare groups with care. Bias occurs when authors use one group (often their own group) as the
standard against which others are judged (e.g., using citizens of the United States as the standard without specifying why that
group  was  chosen).  For  example,  usage  of  “normal”  may  prompt  readers  to  make  the  comparison  with  “abnormal,”  thus
stigmatizing individuals with differences. Likewise, contrasting lesbians with “the general public” or “normal women” portrays
lesbians as marginal to society. More appropriate comparison groups for lesbians might be straight individuals, straight women,
or gay men. Use parallel designations for groups, especially when presenting racial and ethnic information (see Section 5.7).

Be aware that the order of social group presentation may imply that the first-mentioned group is the norm or standard and that
later-mentioned  groups  are  abnormal  or  deviant.  Thus,  the  phrases  “men  and  women”  and  “White  Americans  and  racial
minorities”  subtly  reflect  the  perceived  dominance  of  men  and  White  people  over  other  groups  (furthermore,  listing  specific
racial  minority  groups  is  preferable  to  writing  about  racial  minorities  in  general;  see Section 5.7).  Similarly,  when  presenting
group data, placing socially dominant groups such as men and White people on the left side of a graph or at the top of a table
may  also  imply  that  these  groups  are  the  universal  standard  (Hegarty  &  Buechel,  2006).  When  referring  to  multiple  groups,
thoughtfully consider the order in which to present them. Do not put groups in order of social dominance by default; instead,
consider  options  such  as  alphabetical  order  or  sample  size  order.  For  ease  of  comprehension,  list  groups  in  the  same  order
consistently throughout a paper.

Reducing Bias by Topic

5.3 Age

Age  should  be  reported  as  part  of  the  description  of  participants  in  the  Method  section.  Be  specific  in  providing  age  ranges,
means, and medians (see also Section 5.1). Avoid open-ended definitions such as “under 18 years” or “over 65 years,” unless
referring, for instance, to broad research study eligibility criteria.

Terms for Different Age Groups. Different terms are used for individuals of different ages, and these terms are often gendered
(see Section 5.5). Use the terms individuals use to self-describe, whether these are binary gender categories of boy–girl or man–
woman or descriptive and possibly nonbinary categories of transgender, genderqueer, agender, or gender-fluid.

For an individual of any age, appropriate terms are “person,” “individual,” and so on. In general, avoid using “males” and
“females”  as  nouns;  instead  use  “men”  and  “women”  or  other  age-appropriate  words  (see  Section  5.5).  “Males”  and
“females”  are  appropriate  when  groups  include  individuals  with  a  broad  age  range  (e.g.,  “males”  to  describe  a  group  that
includes both boys and men).

For an individual aged 12 years and younger, appropriate terms are “infant” (for a very young child), “child,” “girl,” “boy,”
“transgender girl,” “transgender boy,” “gender-fluid child,” and so on.

For an individual aged 13 to 17 years, appropriate terms are “adolescent,” “young person,” “youth,” “young woman,” “young
man,” “female adolescent,” “male adolescent,” “agender adolescent,” and so on.

For an individual aged 18 years and older, appropriate terms are “adult,” “woman,” “man,” “transgender man,” “trans man,”
“transgender woman,” “trans woman,” “genderqueer adult,” “cisgender adult,” and so on.

145

Terms  for  Older  Adults.  Older  adults  are  a  subgroup  of  adults,  and  the  age  groups  of  older  adults  may  be  described  with
adjectives. On first reference to a group of older people, be as specific as possible by including the age range, average age, and
median age, when available. Terms such as “older persons,” “older people,” “older adults,” “older patients,” “older individuals,”
“persons  65  years  and  older,”  and  “the  older  population”  are  preferred.  Avoid  using  terms  such  as  “seniors,”  “elderly,”  “the
aged,”  “aging  dependents,”  and  similar  “othering”  terms  because  they  connote  a  stereotype  and  suggest  that  members  of  the
group  are  not  part  of  society  but  rather  a  group  apart  (see  Lundebjerg  et  al.,  2017;  Sweetland  et  al.,  2017).  Do  not  use  these
stigmatizing  terms  in  your  research  even  if  your  participants  use  them  to  refer  to  themselves  (see  Section  5.4  for  similar
guidance regarding disability). Likewise, avoid negativistic and fatalistic attitudes toward aging, such as age as being an obstacle
to overcome (Lindland et al., 2015). Do not use “senile”; it is an outdated term with no agreed-upon meaning. Use “dementia”
instead  of  “senility”;  specify  the  type  of  dementia  when  known  (e.g.,  dementia  due  to  Alzheimer’s  disease).  Be  sure  your
language conveys that aging is a normal part of the human experience and is separate from disease and disorder.

Gerontologists  may  use  combination  terms  for  older  age  groups  (e.g.,  “young-old,”  “old-old,”  “oldest  old”);  provide  the
specific ages of these groups when introducing them in your paper, and use the group names only as adjectives, not  as  nouns
(i.e., refer to “young-old individuals,” not to “the young-old”). When contrasting older adults with adults of other ages, describe
that other age group specifically (e.g., young adults vs. older adults, middle-aged adults vs. older adults). You can use decade-
specific  descriptors  if  desired  (e.g.,  octogenarian,  centenarian).  Generational  descriptors  such  as  “baby  boomers,”  “Gen  X,”
“millennials,” “centennials,” “Gen Z,” and so on should be used only when discussing studies related to the topic of generations.
For more information on writing about age, see “Guidelines for the Evaluation of Dementia and Age-Related Cognitive Change”
(APA, 2012c) and “Guidelines for Psychological Practice With Older Adults” (APA, 2014).

5.4 Disability
Disability is a broad term that is defined in both legal and scientific ways and encompasses physical, psychological, intellectual,
and  socioemotional  impairments  (World  Health  Organization,  2001,  2011).  The  members  of  some  groups  of  people  with
disabilities—effectively subcultures within the larger culture of disability—have particular ways of referring to themselves that
they would prefer others to adopt. When you use the disability language choices made by groups of disabled individuals, you
honor  their  preferences.  For  example,  some  Deaf  individuals  culturally  prefer  to  be  called  “Deaf”  (capitalized)  rather  than
“people with hearing loss” or “people who are deaf” (Dunn & Andrews, 2015). Likewise, use the term “hard of hearing” rather
than “hearing-impaired.” Honoring the preference of the group is not only a sign of professional awareness and respect for any
disability group but also a way to offer solidarity.

The  language  to  use  where  disability  is  concerned  is  evolving.  The  overall  principle  for  using  disability  language  is  to
maintain the integrity (worth and dignity) of all individuals as human beings. Authors who write about disability are encouraged
to  use  terms  and  descriptions  that  both  honor  and  explain  person-first  and  identity-first  perspectives.  Language  should  be
selected  with  the  understanding  that  the  expressed  preference  of  people  with  disabilities  regarding  identification  supersedes
matters of style.

Person-First Language. In person-first language, the person is emphasized, not the individual’s disabling or chronic condition
(e.g., use “a person with paraplegia” and “a youth with epilepsy” rather than “a paraplegic” or “an epileptic”). This principle
applies  to  groups  of  people  as  well  (e.g.,  use  “people  with  substance  use  disorders”  or  “people  with  intellectual  disabilities”
rather than “substance abusers” or “the mentally retarded”; University of Kansas, Research and Training Center on Independent
Living, 2013).

Identity-First Language. In identity-first language, the disability becomes the focus, which allows the individual to claim the
disability  and  choose  their  identity  rather  than  permitting  others  (e.g.,  authors,  educators,  researchers)  to  name  it  or  to  select
terms  with  negative  implications  (Brown,  2011/n.d.;  Brueggemann,  2013;  Dunn  &  Andrews,  2015).  Identity-first  language  is
often used as an expression of cultural pride and a reclamation of a disability that once conferred a negative identity. This type of
language allows for constructions such as “blind person,” “autistic person,” and “amputee,” whereas in person-first language, the
constructions would be “person who is blind,” “person with autism,” and “person with an amputation,” respectively.

Choosing Between Person-First and Identity-First Language. Both person-first and identity-first approaches to language are
designed to respect disabled persons; both are fine choices overall. It is permissible to use either approach or to mix person-first
and identity-first language unless or until you know that a group clearly prefers one approach, in which case, you should use the
preferred approach (Dunn & Andrews, n.d.). Mixing this language may help you avoid cumbersome repetition of “person with

146

.  .  .”  and  is  also  a  means  to  change  how  authors  and  readers  regard  disability  and  people  within  particular  disability
communities. Indeed, the level of disability identity integration can be an effective way to decipher the language that is preferred
by the persons about whom you are writing. Those who embrace their disability as part of their cultural and/or personal identity
are  more  likely  to  prefer  identity-first  language  (Dunn  &  Andrews,  2015).  If  you  are  unsure  of  which  approach  to  use,  seek
guidance from self-advocacy groups or other stakeholders specific to a group of people (see, e.g., Brown, 2011/n.d.). If you are
working with participants directly, use the language they use to describe themselves.

Relevance  of  Mentioning  a  Disability.  The  nature  of  a  disability  should  be  indicated  when  it  is  relevant.  For  example,  if  a
sample included people with spinal cord injuries and people with autism—two different groups with disabilities—then it makes
sense to mention the presence of the particular disabilities. Within each group, there may be additional heterogeneity that should,
under  some  circumstances,  be  articulated  (e.g.,  different  levels  of  spinal  cord  injury,  different  symptom  severities  of  autism
spectrum disorder).

Negative  and  Condescending  Terminology.  Avoid  language  that  uses  pictorial  metaphors  or  negativistic  terms  that  imply
restriction  (e.g.,  “wheelchair  bound”  or  “confined  to  a  wheelchair”;  use  the  term  “wheelchair  user”  instead)  and  that  uses
excessive  and  negative  labels  (e.g.,  “AIDS  victim,”  “brain  damaged”;  use  the  terms  “person  with  AIDS”  or  “person  with  a
traumatic brain injury” instead). Avoid terms that can be regarded as slurs (e.g., “cripple,” “invalid,” “nuts,” “alcoholic,” “meth
addict”); use terms like “person with a physical disability,” “person with a mental illness,” “person with alcohol use disorder,” or
“person  with  substance  use  disorder”  instead,  or  be  more  specific  (e.g.,  “person  with  schizophrenia”).  Labels  such  as  “high
functioning” or “low functioning” are both problematic and ineffective in describing the nuances of an individual’s experience
with  a  developmental  and/or  intellectual  disability;  instead,  specify  the  individual’s  strengths  and  weaknesses.  As  with  other
diverse groups, insiders in disability culture may use negative and condescending terms with one another; it is not appropriate
for an outsider (nondisabled person) to use these terms.

Avoid  euphemisms  that  are  condescending  when  describing  individuals  with  disabilities  (e.g.,  “special  needs,”  “physically
challenged,” “handi-capable”). Many people with disabilities consider these terms patronizing and inappropriate. When writing
about populations or participants with disabilities, emphasize both capabilities and concerns to avoid reducing them to a “bundle
of  deficiencies”  (Rappaport,  1977).  Refer  to  individuals  with  disabilities  as  “patients”  (or  “clients”)  within  the  context  of  a
health care setting (see Section 5.6).

5.5 Gender
Gender  offers  an  added  layer  of  specificity  when  interpreting  patterns  or  phenomena  of  human  behavior.  However,  the  terms
related to gender and sex are often conflated, making precision essential to writing about gender and/or sex without bias. The
language related to gender identity and sexual orientation has also evolved rapidly, and it is important to use the terms people
use  to  describe  themselves  (Singh,  2017;  for  how  to  determine  appropriate  terms,  see  Section  5.2;  for  a  list  of  terms  and
definitions, see APA, n.d.-a).

Gender  Versus  Sex.  Gender  refers  to  the  attitudes,  feelings,  and  behaviors  that  a  given  culture  associates  with  a  person’s
biological sex (APA, 2012b). Gender is a social construct and a social identity. Use the term “gender” when referring to people
as  social  groups.  For  example,  when  reporting  the  genders  of  participants  in  the  Method  section,  write  something  like  this:
“Approximately 60% of participants identified as cisgender women, 35% as cisgender men, 3% as transgender women, 1% as
transgender  men,  and  1%  as  nonbinary.”  Sex  refers  to  biological  sex  assignment;  use  the  term  “sex”  when  the  biological
distinction of sex assignment (e.g., sex assigned at birth) is predominant. Using “gender” instead of “sex” also avoids ambiguity
over  whether  “sex”  means  “sexual  behavior.”  In  some  cases,  there  may  not  be  a  clear  distinction  between  biological  and
acculturative  factors,  so  a  discussion  of  both  sex  and  gender  would  be  appropriate.  For  example,  in  the  study  of  sexual
orientation (see Section 5.8), researchers continue to examine the extent to which sexuality or sexual orientation—attraction to
sex, gender, or some combination of both—is a biological and/or acculturative phenomenon.

Gender Identity. Gender identity is a component of gender that describes a person’s psychological sense of their gender. Many
people describe gender identity as a deeply felt, inherent sense of being a boy, a man, or male; a girl, a woman, or female; or a
nonbinary  gender  (e.g.,  genderqueer,  gender-nonconforming,  gender-neutral,  agender,  gender-fluid)  that  may  or  may  not
correspond  to  a  person’s  sex  assigned  at  birth,  presumed  gender  based  on  sex  assignment,  or  primary  or  secondary  sex
characteristics (APA, 2015a). Gender identity applies to all individuals and is not a characteristic only of transgender or gender-

147

nonconforming  individuals.  Gender  identity  is  distinct  from  sexual  orientation  (see  Section  5.8);  thus,  the  two  must  not  be
conflated (e.g., a gay transgender man has a masculine gender identity and a gay sexual orientation, a straight cisgender woman
has a feminine gender identity and a straight sexual orientation).

Reporting of Gender. Authors  are  strongly  encouraged  to  explicitly  designate  information  about  the  gender  identities  of  the
participants making up their samples (e.g., whether participants are transgender, cisgender, or other gender identities) rather than
assuming cisgender identities. Cisgender refers to individuals whose sex assigned at birth aligns with their gender identity (APA,
2015a). Cisgenderism  or  cissexism  refers  to  the  belief  that  being  cisgender  is  normative,  as  indicated  by  the  assumption  that
individuals are cisgender unless otherwise specified (both terms are in use). Genderism refers to the belief that there are only
two genders and that gender is automatically linked to an individual’s sex assigned at birth (American Psychological Association
of Graduate Students, 2015).

Transgender  and  Gender-Nonconforming  People.  Transgender  is  used  as  an  adjective  to  refer  to  persons  whose  gender
identity,  expression,  and/or  role  does  not  conform  to  what  is  culturally  associated  with  their  sex  assigned  at  birth.  Some
transgender people hold a binary gender, such as man or woman, but others have a gender outside of this binary, such as gender-
fluid or nonbinary. Individuals whose gender varies from presumptions based on their sex assigned at birth may use terms other
than  “transgender”  to  describe  their  gender,  including  “gender-nonconforming,”  “genderqueer,”  “gender-nonbinary,”  “gender-
creative,”  “agender,”  or  “two-spirit,”  to  name  a  few.  (Note  that  “two-spirit”  is  a  term  specific  to  Indigenous  and  Native
American  communities.)  Transprejudice  and  transnegativity  denote  discriminatory  attitudes  toward  individuals  who  are
transgender.  Diverse  identity  terms  are  used  by  transgender  and  gender-nonconforming  (TGNC)  people,  and  “TGNC”  is  a
generally  agreed-upon  umbrella  term.  These  terms  are  generally  used  in  an  identity-first  way  (e.g.,  “transgender  people,”
“TGNC people”). However, there is some variation in the field; for example, clinicians often refer to individuals according to
identity  (self-identified)  or  describe  gender  variance,  gender  expansiveness,  or  gender  diversity  rather  than  gender
nonconformity or nonbinary gender. Be sure to use identity labels that are in accordance with the stated identities of the people
you are describing, and clearly define how you are using such identity labels within your writing.

Sex  Assignment.  The  terms  “birth  sex,”  “natal  sex,”  “tranny,”  and  “transvestite”  are  considered  disparaging  by  scholars  in
TGNC  psychological  research;  by  many  individuals  identifying  as  transgender,  gender-nonconforming,  or  nonbinary;  and  by
people exhibiting gender diversity. Thus, these disparaging terms should be avoided. Additionally, “birth sex” and “natal sex”
imply that sex is an immutable characteristic without sociocultural influence. It is more appropriate to use “assigned sex” or “sex
assigned  at  birth,”  as  this  functionally  describes  the  assignment  of  a  sex  term  (frequently  binary  male  or  female;  however,
intersex is an accurate assignment for some) predicated on observation of genitalia and/or determination of chromosomes and
anatomical structures of the body at birth, which necessarily is interpreted within a sociocultural context. The term “transsexual”
is largely outdated, but some people identify with it; this term should be used only for an individual who specifically claims it.

Gender and Noun Usage. Refer to all people, including transgender people, by the name they use to refer to themselves, which
may  be  different  from  their  legal  name  or  the  name  on  their  birth  certificate,  keeping  in  mind  provisions  for  respecting
confidentiality (see Sections 1.18–1.19; see also Section 1.15 for confidentiality in qualitative research). Likewise, to reduce the
possibility of stereotypic bias and avoid ambiguity, use specific nouns to identify people or groups of people (e.g., women, men,
transgender  men,  trans  men,  transgender  women,  trans  women,  cisgender  women,  cisgender  men,  gender-fluid  people).  Use
“male” and “female” as adjectives (e.g., a male participant, a female experimenter) when appropriate and relevant. Use “male”
and “female” as nouns only when the age range is broad or ambiguous or to identify a transgender person’s sex assignment at
birth (e.g., “person assigned female at birth” is correct, not “person assigned girl at birth”). Otherwise, avoid using “male” and
“female” as nouns and instead use the specific nouns for people of different ages (e.g., women) as described in Section 5.3.

To  refer  to  all  human  beings,  use  terms  like  “individuals,”  “people,”  or  “persons”  rather  than  “man”  or  “mankind”  to  be
accurate  and  inclusive.  Avoid  gendered  endings  such  as  “man”  in  occupational  titles  (e.g.,  use  “police  officer”  instead  of
“policeman”), as these can be ambiguous and may imply incorrectly that all persons in the group self-identify as one gender.
Instead,  use  a  nongendered  term  if  possible  (e.g.,  “homemaker”  instead  of  “housewife”).  If  you  use  sources  that  include  the
generic “man,” generic “he,” or dated occupational titles, clarify the historical context in which these terms were used (for more
details, see the APA Style website at https://apastyle.apa.org).

Gender and Pronoun Usage. Pronoun usage requires specificity and care on the author’s part. Do not refer to the pronouns that
transgender and gender-nonconforming people use as “preferred  pronouns”  because  this  implies  a  choice  about  one’s  gender.

148

Use the terms “identified pronouns,” “self-identified pronouns,” or “pronouns” instead. When writing about a known individual,
use that person’s identified pronouns. Some individuals use “they” as a singular pronoun; some use alternative pronouns such as
“ze,” “xe,” “hir,” “per,” “ve,” “ey,” and “hen” (Swedish gender-neutral pronoun), among others. Some individuals may alternate
between “he” and “she” or between “he and/or she” and “they,” whereas others use no pronouns at all and use their name in
place of pronouns. Refer to a transgender person using language appropriate to the person’s gender, regardless of sex assigned at
birth—for  example,  use  the  pronouns  “he,”  “him,”  and  “his”  in  reference  to  a  transgender  man  who  indicates  use  of  these
pronouns.

When  referring  to  individuals  whose  identified  pronouns  are  not  known  or  when  the  gender  of  a  generic  or  hypothetical
person is irrelevant within the context, use the singular “they” to avoid making assumptions about an individual’s gender. Use
the forms “they,” “them,” “theirs,” and so forth. Sexist bias can occur when pronouns are used carelessly, as when the pronoun
“he” is used to refer to all people, when a gendered pronoun is used exclusively to define roles by sex (e.g., “the nurse . . . she”),
or when “he” and “she” are alternated as though these terms are generic. Pronouns associated with a specific gender have been
found to induce readers to think of individuals of that gender even when the pronoun use is intended to be generic (Gastil, 1990;
Moulton et al., 1978). In addition, exposure to gender-specific language in a professional context has been linked with a lower
sense of belonging, reduced motivation, and professional disidentification for individuals who do not identify with that gender
(Stout & Dasgupta, 2011). When writers use the singular “they,” it reduces bias in the way that readers perceive the individuals
referred to in the text and thereby helps ensure that readers do not feel ostracized by that text.

Avoid using combinations such as “he or she,” “she or he,” “he/she,” and “(s)he” as alternatives to the singular “they” because
such constructions imply an exclusively binary nature of gender and exclude individuals who do not use these pronouns. These
forms can also appear awkward and distracting, especially with repetition. However, the combinations “he or she” or “she or he”
(but not the combinations with slashes or parentheses) can be used sparingly if all people being referred to by the pronouns use
these terms. For further guidance on and examples of how to use the singular “they,” see Section 4.18.

Terms  That  Imply  Binaries.  Avoid  referring  to  one  sex  or  gender  as  the  “opposite  sex”  or  “opposite  gender”;  appropriate
wording  may  be  “another  sex”  or  “another  gender.”  The  word  “opposite”  implies  strong  differences  between  two  sexes  or
genders; however, there are more similarities than differences among people of different genders or sexes (see, e.g., Zell et al.,
2015). As noted previously, some individuals do not identify with either binary gender, and these phrases ignore the existence of
individuals  who  have  disorders  or  differences  of  sex  development  or  who  are  intersex  (for  more  information,  see  Accord
Alliance,  n.d.;  APA,  2015a;  Blackless  et  al.,  2000;  Intersex  Society  of  North  America,  n.d.).  To  describe  members  of  a
relationship (e.g., romantic couples, people in polyamorous relationships), use the phrases “mixed gender” or “mixed sex” when
the partners have different genders or sexes, rather than “opposite gender” or “opposite sex”; use the phrases “same gender” or
“same sex” when the partners have the same gender or sex.

5.6 Participation in Research
People participate in research in a variety of settings, including laboratories, homes, schools, businesses, clinics, and hospitals.
Specific terms are used in certain contexts. When writing about people who participate in research, descriptive terms such as
“college students,” “children,” or “respondents” as well as the more general terms “participants” and “subjects” are acceptable.
“Subjects”  and  “sample”  are  also  customary  when  discussing  established  statistical  terms  and  experimental  designs  (e.g.,
“within-subjects design,” “between-subjects design,” “sample-size-adjusted Bayesian information criterion,” “between-samples
estimate of the variance”).

Use the term “patient” to describe an individual diagnosed with a mental health, behavioral health, and/or medical disease,
disorder,  or  problem  who  is  receiving  services  from  a  health  care  provider  (e.g.,  psychologist,  physician,  nurse,  or  other
provider).  This  language  is  consistent  with  the  language  used  in  the  health  care  system  and  promotes  psychologists  as  being
perceived  a  part  of,  and  consistently  integrated  into,  the  culture  of  interprofessional,  integrated  health  care.  However,  in
academic,  business,  school,  or  other  settings,  the  term  “client”  (or  some  other  term)  might  be  preferred  instead  of  “patient.”
Within all contexts, respect the individual and/or cultural preferences expressed by recipients of psychological services and their
families  when  you  choose  language  to  describe  those  individuals,  families,  or  populations.  (For  further  information,  see
Resolution for the Use of the Term Patient; APA, 2018.)

It is also important to recognize the difference between a case, which is an occurrence of a disorder or illness, and a person
who is affected by the disorder or illness and is receiving care from a health care professional. For instance, “manic–depressive
cases were treated” is problematic; revising the sentence to read “the people with bipolar disorder were treated” differentiates the
people from the disorder. Likewise, in the medical context, avoid the terms “patient management” and “patient placement”; in

149

most cases, the treatment, not the patient, is managed; some alternatives are “coordination of care,” “supportive services,” and
“assistance.”

Broad clinical terms such as “borderline” and “at risk” should be properly explained when used. Avoid using these terms in a
broad  sense  (e.g.,  “the  diagnosis  was  borderline,”  “at-risk  students”)  because  such  usage  obscures  the  specific  clinical  or
psychometric meaning of the terms. For example, “the diagnosis was borderline” in a neuropsychology and psychometric testing
context  may  be  clarified  to  specify  a  score  on  a  specific  test  or  instrument  (e.g.,  “standard  scores  between  70  and  80  are
considered psychometrically borderline, or between the low average and mildly impaired ranges, indicating a risk for a diagnosis
of X”), whereas in a diagnostic context, “the diagnosis was borderline” may be clarified to specify a diagnosis (e.g., borderline
personality disorder). When using the term “at risk,” specify who is at risk and the nature of that risk (e.g., “adolescents who use
substances are at risk for early school dropout”).

Across  contexts,  write  about  the  people  who  participated  in  your  work  in  a  way  that  acknowledges  their  contributions  and
agency. Sentence structure plays a key role in this acknowledgment, as does using professional language (see Section 4.7). Use
the active voice to describe your actions and the actions of participants (see Section 4.13); the passive voice suggests individuals
are acted upon instead of being actors (e.g., “the subjects completed the trial” and “we collected data from the participants” are
preferable to “the trial was completed by the subjects” and “the participants were run”). Avoid the term “failed,” as in “eight
participants failed to complete the Rorschach test,” because it can imply a personal shortcoming instead of a research result; “did
not complete” is a more neutral choice (Knatterud, 1991). These choices will help ensure that you convey respect for the people
about whom you are writing.

5.7 Racial and Ethnic Identity
Terms used to refer to racial and ethnic groups continue to change over time. One reason for this is simply personal preference;
preferred designations are as varied as the people they name. Another reason is that designations can become dated over time
and may hold negative connotations. When describing racial and ethnic groups, be appropriately specific and sensitive to issues
of labeling (see Sections 5.1–5.2).

Race refers to physical differences that groups and cultures consider socially significant. For example, people might identify
their race as Aboriginal, African American or Black, Asian, European American or White, Native American, Native Hawaiian or
Pacific  Islander,  Māori,  or  some  other  race.  Ethnicity  refers  to  shared  cultural  characteristics  such  as  language,  ancestry,
practices,  and  beliefs.  For  example,  people  might  identify  as  Latino  or  another  ethnicity.  Be  clear  about  whether  you  are
referring to a racial group or to an ethnic group. Race is a social construct that is not universal, so one must be careful not to
impose racial labels on ethnic groups. Whenever possible, use the racial and/or ethnic terms that your participants themselves
use.  Be  sure  that  the  racial  and  ethnic  categories  you  use  are  as  clear  and  specific  as  possible.  For  example,  instead  of
categorizing participants as Asian American or Hispanic American, you could use more specific labels that identify their nation
or  region  of  origin,  such  as  Japanese  American  or  Cuban  American.  Use  commonly  accepted  designations  (e.g.,  census
categories) while being sensitive to participants’ preferred designation.

Spelling and Capitalization of Racial and Ethnic Terms. Racial and ethnic groups are designated by proper nouns and are
capitalized.  Therefore,  use  “Black”  and  “White”  instead  of  “black”  and  “white”  (do  not  use  colors  to  refer  to  other  human
groups;  doing  so  is  considered  pejorative).  Likewise,  capitalize  terms  such  as  “Native  American,”  “Hispanic,”  and  so  on.
Capitalize “Indigenous” and “Aboriginal” whenever they are used. Capitalize “Indigenous People” or “Aboriginal People” when
referring to a specific group (e.g., the Indigenous Peoples of Canada), but use lowercase for “people” when describing persons
who are Indigenous or Aboriginal (e.g., “the authors were all Indigenous people but belonged to different nations”).

Do not use hyphens in multiword names, even if the names act as unit modifiers (e.g., write “Asian American participants,”
not “Asian-American participants”). If people belong to multiple racial or ethnic groups, the names of the specific groups are
capitalized, but the terms “multiracial,” “biracial,” “multi-ethnic,” and so on are lowercase.

Terms for Specific Groups. Designations for specific ethnic and racial groups are described next. These groups frequently are
included  in  studies  published  in  APA  journals;  the  examples  provided  are  far  from  exhaustive  but  illustrate  some  of  the
complexities of labeling.

People of African Origin. When writing about people of African ancestry, several factors inform the appropriate terms to use.
People of African descent have widely varied cultural backgrounds, family histories, and family experiences. Some will be from
Caribbean islands, Latin America, various regions in the United States, countries in Africa, or elsewhere. Some American people

150

of  African  ancestry  prefer  “Black,”  and  others  prefer  “African  American”;  both  terms  are  acceptable.  However,  “African
American”  should  not  be  used  as  an  umbrella  term  for  people  of  African  ancestry  worldwide  because  it  obscures  other
ethnicities or national origins, such as Nigerian, Kenyan, Jamaican, or Bahamian; in these cases use “Black.” The terms “Negro”
and “Afro-American” are outdated; therefore, their use is generally inappropriate.

People of Asian Origin. When writing about people of Asian ancestry from Asia, the term “Asian” is appropriate; for people of
Asian descent from the United States or Canada, the appropriate term is “Asian American” or “Asian Canadian,” respectively. It
is  problematic  to  group  “Asian”  and  “Asian  American”  as  if  they  are  synonymous.  This  usage  reinforces  the  idea  that  Asian
Americans are perpetual foreigners. “Asian” refers to Asians in Asia, not in the United States, and should not be used to refer to
Asian Americans. The older term “Oriental” is primarily used to refer to cultural objects such as carpets and is pejorative when
used  to  refer  to  people.  To  provide  more  specificity,  “Asian  origin”  may  be  divided  regionally,  for  example,  into  South  Asia
(including  most  of  India  and  countries  such  as  Afghanistan,  Pakistan,  Bangladesh,  and  Nepal),  Southeast  Asia  (including  the
eastern  parts  of  India  and  countries  such  as  Vietnam,  Cambodia,  Thailand,  Indonesia,  and  the  Philippines),  and  East  Asia
(including countries such as China, Vietnam, Japan, South Korea and North Korea, and Taiwan). The corresponding terms (e.g.,
East Asian) can be used; however, refer to the specific nation or region of origin when possible.

People of European Origin. When writing about people of European ancestry, the terms “White” and “European American” are
acceptable.  Adjust  the  latter  term  as  needed  for  location,  for  example,  “European,”  “European  American,”  and  “European
Australian” for people of European descent living in Europe, the United States, and Australia, respectively. The use of the term
“Caucasian”  as  an  alternative  to  “White”  or  “European”  is  discouraged  because  it  originated  as  a  way  of  classifying  White
people as a race to be favorably compared with other races. As with all discussions of race and ethnicity, it is preferable to be
more specific about regional (e.g., Southern European, Scandinavian) or national (e.g., Italian, Irish, Swedish, French, Polish)
origin when possible.

Indigenous  Peoples  Around  the  World.  When  writing  about  Indigenous  Peoples,  use  the  names  that  they  call  themselves.  In
general, refer to an Indigenous group as a “people” or “nation” rather than as a “tribe.”

In  North  America,  the  collective  terms  “Native  American”  and  “Native  North  American”  are  acceptable  (and  may  be
preferred to “American Indian”). “Indian” usually refers to people from India. Specify the nation or people if possible (e.g.,
Cherokee, Navajo, Sioux).

Hawaiian  Natives  may  identify  as  “Native  American,”  “Hawaiian  Native,”  “Indigenous  Peoples  of  the  Hawaiian  Islands,”
and/or “Pacific Islander.”

In  Canada,  refer  to  the  Indigenous  Peoples  collectively  as  “Indigenous  Peoples”  or  “Aboriginal  Peoples”  (International
Journal  of  Indigenous  Health,  n.d.);  specify  the  nation  or  people  if  possible  (e.g.,  People  of  the  First  Nations  of  Canada,
People of the First Nations, or First Nations People; Métis; Inuit).

In Alaska, the Indigenous People may identify as “Alaska Natives.” The Indigenous Peoples in Alaska, Canada, Siberia, and
Greenland  may  identify  as  a  specific  nation  (e.g.,  Inuit,  Iñupiat).  Avoid  the  term  “Eskimo”  because  it  may  be  considered
pejorative.

In  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean,  refer  to  the  Indigenous  Peoples  collectively  as  “Indigenous  Peoples”  and  by  name  if
possible (e.g., Quechua, Aymara, Taíno, Nahuatl).

In  Australia,  the  Indigenous  Peoples  may  identify  as  “Aboriginal  People”  or  “Aboriginal  Australians”  and  “Torres  Strait
Islander  People”  or  “Torres  Strait  Island  Australians.”  Refer  to  specific  groups  when  people  use  these  terms  to  refer  to
themselves (e.g., Anangu Pitjantjatjara, Arrernte).

In  New  Zealand,  the  Indigenous  People  may  identify  as  “Māori”  or  the  “Māori  people”  (the  proper  spelling  includes  the
diacritical macron over the “a”).

For information on citing the Traditional Knowledge or Oral Traditions of Indigenous Peoples as well as the capitalization of
terms related to Indigenous Peoples, see Section 8.9.

People of Middle Eastern Origin. When writing about people of Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) descent, state the
nation  of  origin  (e.g.,  Iran,  Iraq,  Egypt,  Lebanon,  Israel)  when  possible.  In  some  cases,  people  of  MENA  descent  who  claim
Arab ancestry and reside in the United States may be referred to as “Arab Americans.” In all cases, it is best to allow individuals
to self-identify.

151

People of Hispanic or Latinx Ethnicity. When writing about people who identify as Hispanic, Latino (or Latinx, etc.), Chicano,
or  another  related  designation,  authors  should  consult  with  their  participants  to  determine  the  appropriate  choice.  Note  that
“Hispanic” is not necessarily an all-encompassing term, and the labels “Hispanic” and “Latino” have different connotations. The
term “Latino” (and its related forms) might be preferred by those originating from Latin America, including Brazil. Some use
the word “Hispanic” to refer to those who speak Spanish; however, not every group in Latin America speaks Spanish (e.g., in
Brazil,  the  official  language  is  Portuguese).  The  word  “Latino”  is  gendered  (i.e.,  “Latino”  is  masculine  and  “Latina”  is
feminine); the use of the word “Latin@” to mean both Latino and Latina is now widely accepted. “Latinx” can also be used as a
gender-neutral  or  nonbinary  term  inclusive  of  all  genders.  There  are  compelling  reasons  to  use  any  of  the  terms  “Latino,”
“Latina,” “Latino/a,” “Latin@,” and/or “Latinx” (see de Onís, 2017), and various groups advocate for the use of different forms.
Use the term(s) your participants or population uses; if you are not working directly with this population but it is a focus of
your research, it may be helpful to explain why you chose the term you used or to choose a more inclusive term like “Latinx.” In
general, naming a nation or region of origin is preferred (e.g., Bolivian, Salvadoran, or Costa Rican is more specific than Latino,
Latinx, Latin American, or Hispanic).

Parallel  Comparisons  Among  Groups.  Nonparallel  designations  (e.g.,  “African  Americans  and  Whites,”  “Asian  Americans
and Black Americans”) should be avoided because one group is described by color, whereas the other group is not. Instead, use
“Blacks  and  Whites”  or  “African  Americans  and  European  Americans”  for  the  former  example  and  “Asian  Americans  and
African Americans” for the latter example. Do not use the phrase “White Americans and racial minorities”; the rich diversity
within racial minorities is minimized when it is compared with the term “White Americans.”

Avoiding  Essentialism.  Language  that  essentializes  or  reifies  race  is  strongly  discouraged  and  is  generally  considered
inappropriate.  For  example,  phrases  such  as  “the  Black  race”  and  “the  White  race”  are  essentialist  in  nature,  portray  human
groups monolithically, and often perpetuate stereotypes.

Writing About “Minorities.” To refer to non-White racial and ethnic groups collectively, use terms such as “people of color” or
“underrepresented  groups”  rather  than  “minorities.”  The  use  of  “minority”  may  be  viewed  pejoratively  because  it  is  usually
equated  with  being  less  than,  oppressed,  or  deficient  in  comparison  with  the  majority  (i.e.,  White  people).  Rather,  a minority
group is a population subgroup with ethnic, racial, social, religious, or other characteristics different from those of the majority
of the population, though the relevance of this term is changing as the demographics of the population change (APA, 2015a). If a
distinction is needed between the dominant racial group and nondominant racial groups, use a modifier (e.g., “ethnic,” “racial”)
when using the word “minority” (e.g., ethnic minority, racial minority, racial-ethnic minority). When possible, use the specific
name of the group or groups to which you are referring.

Do not assume that members of minority groups are underprivileged; underprivileged means having less money, education,
resources, and so forth than the other people in a society and may refer to individuals or subgroups in any racial or ethnic group.
Terms  such  as  “economically  marginalized”  and  “economically  exploited”  may  also  be  used  rather  than  “underprivileged.”
Whenever  possible,  use  more  specific  terms  (e.g.,  schools  with  majority  Black  populations  that  are  underfunded)  or  refer  to
discrimination or systematic oppression as a whole.

5.8 Sexual Orientation
Sexual orientation is a part of individual identity that includes “a person’s sexual and emotional attraction to another person and
the  behavior  and/or  social  affiliation  that  may  result  from  this  attraction”  (APA,  2015a,  p.  862).  Use  the  term  “sexual
orientation” rather than “sexual preference,” “sexual identity,” or “sexual orientation identity.” All people choose their partners
regardless of their sexual orientation; however, the orientation itself is not a choice.

Sexual  orientation  can  be  conceptualized  first  by  the  degree  to  which  a  person  feels  sexual  and  emotional  attraction;  some
parallel  terms  are  “sexual,”  “demisexual”  (or  “gray-asexual”  or  “gray-A”),  and  “asexual”  (see  The  Asexual  Visibility  &
Education Network, n.d.). A person who identifies as sexual feels sexual and emotional attraction toward some or all types of
people, a person who identifies as demisexual feels sexually attracted only within the context of a strong emotional connection
with another person, and a person who identifies as asexual does not experience sexual attraction or has little interest in sexual
behavior (see APA, 2015b).

Second, sexual orientation can be conceptualized as having a direction. For people who identify as sexual or demisexual, their
attraction  then  may  be  directed  toward  people  who  are  similarly  gendered,  differently  gendered,  and  so  on.  That  is,  sexual
orientation indicates the gendered directionality of attraction, even if that directionality is very inclusive (e.g., nonbinary). Thus,

152

a  person  might  be  attracted  to  men,  women,  both,  neither,  masculinity,  femininity,  and/or  to  people  who  have  other  gender
identities such as genderqueer or androgynous, or a person may have an attraction that is not predicated on a perceived or known
gender identity.

Terms for Sexual Orientation. Some examples of sexual orientation are lesbian, gay, heterosexual, straight, asexual, bisexual,
queer,  polysexual,  and  pansexual  (also  called  multisexual  and  omnisexual).  For  example,  a  person  who  identifies  as  lesbian
might describe herself as a woman (gender identity) who is attracted to women (sexual orientation)—the sexual orientation label
of  “lesbian”  is  predicated  on  a  perceived  or  known  gender  identity  of  the  other  person.  However,  someone  who  identifies  as
pansexual  might  describe  their  attraction  to  people  as  being  inclusive  of  gender  identity  but  not  determined  or  delineated  by
gender identity. Note that these definitions are evolving and that self-identification is best when possible.

Use  the  umbrella  term  “sexual  and  gender  minorities”  to  refer  to  multiple  sexual  and/or  gender  minority  groups,  or  write
about “sexual orientation and gender diversity” (these terms are used by the Office on Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity
at APA and the Sexual & Gender Minority Research Office at the National Institutes of Health). Abbreviations such as LGBTQ,
LGBTQ+, LGBTQIA, and LGBTQIA+ may also be used to refer to multiple groups. The form “LGBT” is considered outdated,
but there is not consensus about which abbreviation including or beyond LGBTQ to use. If you use the abbreviation LGBTQ (or
a  related  one),  define  it  (see  Section 6.25)  and  ensure  that  it  is  representative  of  the  groups  about  which  you  are  writing.  Be
specific about the groups to which you refer (e.g., do not use LGBTQ and related abbreviations to write about legislation that
primarily affects transgender people; instead, specify the impacted group). However, if in doubt, use one of the umbrella terms
rather than a potentially inaccurate abbreviation.

When  using  specific  terms  for  orientations,  define  them  if  there  is  ambiguity.  For  example,  the  adjective  “gay”  can  be
interpreted broadly, to include all genders, or more narrowly, to include only men, so define “gay” when you use it in your paper,
or use the phrase “gay men” to clarify the usage. By convention, the term “lesbians” is appropriate to use interchangeably with
“lesbian women,” but “gay men” or “gay people” should be used, not “gays.”

Inaccurate or Pejorative Terms. Avoid the terms “homosexual” and “homosexuality.” Instead, use specific, identity-first terms
to describe people’s sexual orientation (e.g., bisexual people, queer people). These specific terms refer primarily to identities and
to the culture and communities that have developed among people who share those identities. It is inaccurate to collapse these
communities into the term “homosexual.” Furthermore, the term “homosexuality” has been and continues to be associated with
negative  stereotypes,  pathology,  and  the  reduction  of  people’s  identities  to  their  sexual  behavior. Homoprejudice,  biprejudice,
homonegativity, and so forth are terms used to denote prejudicial and discriminatory attitudes toward lesbians, gay men, bisexual
individuals,  or  other  sexual  minorities.  Heterosexism  refers  to  the  belief  that  heterosexuality  is  normative,  as  indicated  in  the
assumption  that  individuals  are  heterosexual  unless  otherwise  specified  (American  Psychological  Association  of  Graduate
Students, 2015). The terms “straight” and “heterosexual” are both acceptable to use when referring to people who are attracted to
individuals  of  another  gender;  the  term  “straight”  may  help  move  the  lexicon  away  from  a  dichotomy  of  heterosexual  and
homosexual. For more information regarding sexual orientation, see “Guidelines for Psychological Practice With Transgender
and Gender Nonconforming People” (APA, 2015a).

5.9 Socioeconomic Status
Socioeconomic status (SES) encompasses not only income but also educational attainment, occupational prestige, and subjective
perceptions  of  social  status  and  social  class.  SES  encompasses  quality  of  life  attributes  and  opportunities  afforded  to  people
within society and is a consistent predictor of a vast array of psychological outcomes. Thus, SES should be reported as part of
the  description  of  participants  in  the  Method  section.  Because  SES  is  complex,  it  is  not  indexed  similarly  in  all  studies;
therefore, precise terminology that appropriately describes a level of specificity and sensitivity is essential to minimize bias in
language around SES (for a discussion, see Diemer et al., 2013).

Reporting SES. When reporting SES, provide as much detailed information as possible about people’s income, education, and
occupations  or  employment  circumstances.  For  example,  when  referring  to  “low-income  participants”  or  “high-income
participants,”  classify  whether  reported  incomes  take  into  account  household  size,  or  provide  information  about  the  relation
between household incomes and federal poverty guidelines. Additionally, SES can be described by providing information related
to specific contextual and environmental conditions such as participants’ housing arrangement (e.g., renting a home, owning a
home,  residing  in  subsidized  housing)  and  neighborhood  characteristics  such  as  median  household  income,  percentage  of
unemployed people, or proportion of students who qualify for free or reduced-price lunch in local schools.

153

Pejorative or Stereotyping Terms. Avoid using broad, pejorative, and generalizing terms to discuss SES. Specifically, negative
connotations  are  associated  with  terms  such  as  “the  homeless,”  “inner-city,”  “ghetto,”  “the  projects,”  “poverty  stricken,” and
“welfare reliant.” Instead, use specific, person-first language such as “mothers who receive TANF benefits” rather than “welfare
mothers”  (“TANF”  stands  for  “Temporary  Assistance  for  Needy  Families”  and  is  the  proper  term  for  the  current  welfare
program in the United States). When discussing people without a fixed, regular, or adequate nighttime residence, use specific
language that addresses the quality or lack of housing or length of time without housing, not whether the people consider their
residence  a  home.  That  is,  use  language  like  “people  experiencing  homelessness,”  “people  who  are  homeless,”  “people  in
emergency shelter,” or “people in transitional housing,” rather than calling people “the homeless.”

It is important to note that SES terms such as “low income” and “poor” have historically served as implicit descriptors for
racial and/or ethnic minority people. Thus, it is critical that authors include racial and/or ethnic descriptors within SES categories
—for example, “This sample includes low-income and middle-income Puerto Rican fathers.” Implicit biases around economic
and  occupational  status  can  result  in  deficit-based  language  that  blames  individuals  for  their  occupational,  educational,  or
economic  situation  (e.g.,  “attendant  economic  deficits”)  rather  than  recognizing  a  broader  societal  context  that  influences
individual circumstances. Deficit-based language also focuses on what people lack rather than on what they possess. Instead of
labeling  people  as  “high  school  dropouts,”  “being  poorly  educated,”  or  “having  little  education,”  provide  more  sensitive  and
specific  descriptors  such  as  “people  who  do  not  have  a  high  school  diploma  or  equivalent.”  Alternatively,  by  adopting  a
strengths-based perspective, authors can write about “people who have a grade school education.” Likewise, instead of writing
about an “achievement gap,” write about an “opportunity gap” to emphasize how the context in which people live affects their
outcomes or opportunities.

5.10 Intersectionality
When  authors  write  about  personal  characteristics,  they  should  be  sensitive  to  intersectionality—that  is,  to  the  way  in  which
individuals  are  shaped  by  and  identify  with  a  vast  array  of  cultural,  structural,  sociobiological,  economic,  and  social  contexts
(Howard & Renfrow, 2014). Intersectionality is a paradigm that addresses the multiple dimensions of identity and social systems
as  they  intersect  with  one  another  and  relate  to  inequality,  such  as  racism,  genderism,  heterosexism,  ageism,  and  classism,
among other variables (APA, 2017b). Thus, individuals are located within a range of social groups whose structural inequalities
can result in marginalized identities.

Because  people  are  unique,  many  identities  are  possible.  As  one  example  of  a  group  with  an  intersectional  identity,  Black
lesbian women may have similarities to and differences from other oppressed groups in the meanings that are assigned to their
multiple positionalities. Black women may identify with the oppressive and discriminatory experiences of White women as well
as with those of Black men. At the same time, Black lesbian women’s experiences may not be equivalent to those of these other
groups. They may experience discrimination as a response to their race, gender, and/or sexual orientation. Thus, their experience
does not necessarily reflect the sum of oppressions of racism, sexism, and heteronormativity (i.e., race + sex + heterosexism) but
rather their unique identities and social locations as Black lesbian women that are not based in or driven by the perspectives of
White women or of Black men (Bowleg, 2008; Crenshaw, 1989). That is, for example, even though Black women and White
women  are  both  women,  and  Black  women  and  Black  men  are  both  Black,  this  does  not  mean  that  the  perspectives  and
experiences of the latter groups are the same as or related to those of Black lesbian women.

Intersectional identities also include experiences of privileged contexts that intersect with those of oppression. For example, a
Laotian  immigrant  woman  with  a  disability  may  experience  a  sense  of  safety  and  privilege  because  of  her  legal  immigration
status  in  the  United  States,  but  she  may  experience  discrimination  and  a  lack  of  access  to  appropriate  resources  within  and
outside of her family and ethnic community on the basis of her disability status. A Jewish American adolescent may experience
privilege as a result of being perceived as White but may be the target of anti-Semitic slurs at school and in social media because
of their religious beliefs. These examples illustrate how perspectives are shaped by the multiplicity of identities and contexts to
which an individual belongs, some oppressed and some privileged. Aspects of identity such as race, gender, and class can be
oppressed or privileged, in ways that may differ across contexts, and can result in differing experiences that interact dynamically
to  shape  an  individual’s  experiences,  advantages,  and  disadvantages  across  time  and  space.  The  intersections  of  multiple
identities transform the oppressed and privileged aspects of each person’s layered, interlocking identities.

To  address  intersectionality  in  a  paper,  identify  individuals’  relevant  characteristics  and  group  memberships  (e.g.,  ability
and/or  disability  status,  age,  gender,  gender  identity,  generation,  historical  as  well  as  ongoing  experiences  of  marginalization,
immigrant  status,  language,  national  origin,  race  and/or  ethnicity,  religion  or  spirituality,  sexual  orientation,  social  class,  and
socioeconomic status, among other variables), and describe how their characteristics and group memberships intersect in ways

154

that are relevant to the study. Report participant data for each group using specific terms as described in Sections 5.3 to 5.9. For
example, when describing participants in terms of their race and gender, write “20 participants were African American women,
15  participants  were  European  American  women,  23  participants  were  African  American  men,  and  18  participants  were
European American men (all participants were cisgender)” rather than “35 participants were women and 41 were men; 43 were
African American and 33 were European American.” Reporting participant characteristics in this way helps readers understand
how  many  groups  there  are  that  are  composed  of  individuals  with  the  same  characteristics.  Likewise,  when  reporting  and
interpreting  the  results,  note  the  impact  of  any  intersections  on  the  findings  rather  than  assuming  that  one  characteristic  is
responsible  for  what  you  found.  For  more  discussion  of  intersectionality,  see  the  Multicultural  Guidelines:  An  Ecological
Approach to Context, Identity, and Intersectionality (APA, 2017b).

M EC H A N IC S OF STYLE

Style  refers  to  guidelines  for  ensuring  clear,  consistent  communication  and  presentation  in  written  works.  APA  Style,  as
described in this Publication Manual, provides guidelines for writing scholarly papers. Publishers and instructors often require
authors  writing  for  publication  and  students  writing  for  a  course  or  degree  requirement  to  follow  specific  style  guidelines  to
avoid  inconsistencies  among  and  within  journal  articles,  book  chapters,  and  academic  papers.  For  example,  without  style
guidelines, authors might use the spellings “health care,” “health-care,” and “healthcare” interchangeably in one work. Although
their meaning is the same and the choice of one style over another may seem arbitrary (in this case, “health care,” with a space
and no hyphen, is APA Style), such variations in style can distract or confuse readers.

In  this  chapter,  we  provide  essential  style  guidelines  for  scholarly  writing,  including  punctuation,  spelling,  capitalization,
italics, abbreviations, numbers, statistical and mathematical copy, and lists. These guidelines often overlap with those for general
good writing practices. However, we omit general grammar rules explained in widely available writing manuals and examples of
grammar or usage with little relevance to manuscripts submitted to journals that use APA Style. Style manuals agree more often
than they disagree; when they disagree, the Publication Manual takes precedence for APA Style papers or publications.

Punctuation

Punctuation establishes the cadence of a sentence, telling readers where to pause (comma, semicolon, and colon), stop (period
and question mark), or take a detour (dash, parentheses, and square brackets). Punctuation of a sentence usually denotes a pause
in thought; different kinds of punctuation indicate different kinds and lengths of pauses.

6.1 Spacing After Punctuation Marks
Insert one space after the following:

periods or other punctuation marks at the end of a sentence

commas, colons, and semicolons

periods that separate parts of a reference list entry (see Section 9.5)

periods following initials in names (M. P. Clark)

Do not insert a space in the following cases:

after internal periods in abbreviations (e.g., a.m., i.e., U.S.)

after periods in identity-concealing labels for study participants (F.I.M.)

around colons in ratios (1:4)

Note: We recommend using one space after the period or other punctuation mark at the end of a sentence; however, follow the
guidelines of your publisher or instructor if they have different requirements.

159

6.2 Period
Use a period or periods in the following cases:

to end a complete sentence

with initials in names (Bazerman, M. H.)

in  the  abbreviations  for  “United  States”  and  “United  Kingdom”  when  they  are  used  as  adjectives  (U.S.  Navy;  it  is  not
required to abbreviate these terms)

in identity-concealing labels for study participants (F.I.M.)

in Latin abbreviations (a.m., cf., e.g., i.e., p.m., vs.)

in reference abbreviations (Vol. 1, 2nd ed., p. 6, paras. 11–12, F. Supp.)

in era designations (B.C.E., C.E., B.C., A.D.; see Section 9.42)

to end each element within a reference (except DOIs and URLs; see Section 9.5)

Do not use periods in the following cases:

in abbreviations of state, province, or territory names (NY; CA; Washington, DC; BC; ON; NSW)

in capital letter abbreviations and acronyms (APA, NDA, NIMH, IQ)

in abbreviations for academic degrees (PhD, PsyD, EdD, MD, MA, RN, MSW, LCSW, etc.; see Section 2.5)

in abbreviations for routes of administration (icv, im, ip, iv, sc)

in metric and nonmetric measurement abbreviations (cm, hr, kg, min, ml, s)

after URLs in the text (see Section 8.22); instead, place URLs in the middle of the sentence or in parentheses to avoid ending
a sentence with a URL

after DOIs or URLs in the reference list (see Section 9.35)

Note: Use a period with the abbreviation for “inch” or “inches” (in.) because otherwise it could be misread.

6.3 Comma
Use a comma in the following cases:

between elements in a series of three or more items, including before the final item (see also Section 6.49); this last comma is
called a serial comma or Oxford comma

Correct: height, width, and depth

Incorrect: height, width and depth

after an introductory phrase (if the introductory phrase is short, the comma after it is optional)

After the nurses administered the medication, patients rated their pain.

to  set  off  a  nonessential  or  nonrestrictive  clause  (see  Section  4.21)—that  is,  a  clause  that  embellishes  a  sentence  but  if
removed would leave the grammatical structure and meaning of the sentence intact

Strong fearful faces, which are rarely seen in everyday life, convey intense expression of negative emotions.

Do not use a comma in the following cases:

before an essential or restrictive clause (see Section 4.21) because removing such a clause from the sentence would alter the
intended meaning

6.5 Colon
Use a colon in the following cases:

161

between  a  grammatically  complete  introductory  clause  (one  that  could  stand  alone  as  a  sentence,  including  an  imperative
statement) and a final phrase or clause that illustrates, extends, or amplifies the preceding thought (if the clause following the
colon is a complete sentence, begin it with a capital letter; see Section 6.13)

6.6 Dash
Two kinds of dash are used in APA Style: the em dash (long dash) and the en dash (midsized dash). These dashes are different
from hyphens (see Section 6.12) and minus signs (see Section 6.45).

Em Dash.  Use  an  em  dash  to  set  off  an  element  added  to  amplify  or  digress  from  the  main  clause.  Overuse  of  the  em  dash
weakens the flow of material, so use it judiciously. Do not use a space before or after an em dash. Word-processing programs
can be set to automatically convert two back-to-back hyphens to an em dash. (See Section 6.17 for capitalization following em
dashes in titles.)

Social adjustment—but not academic adjustment—was associated with extraversion.

En Dash. An en dash is longer and thinner than a hyphen but shorter than an em dash. Use an en dash between words of equal
weight in a compound adjective and to indicate a numerical range, such as a page or date range. Do not insert a space before or
after an en dash. Word-processing programs have options for inserting an en dash.

50%–60%

A hyphen rather than an en dash is generally used in an abbreviation that contains dashes, such as the abbreviation for a test or
scale (e.g., MMPI-2) or a diagnostic manual (DSM-5, ICD-11; see Section 6.25).

6.7 Quotation Marks
This section addresses how to use quotation marks other than with direct quotations (see Sections 8.25–8.36). Quotation marks
often appear with other punctuation marks. Place commas and periods inside closing quotation marks. Place other punctuation
marks (e.g., colons, semicolons, ellipses) outside closing quotation marks.

Use double quotation marks in the following cases:

to refer to a letter, word, phrase, or sentence as a linguistic example or as itself

the letter “m”

the singular “they”

answered “yes” or “no”

Instead of referring to someone as a “defective child,” talk about a “child with a congenital disability” or a “child with a birth impairment.”

to present stimuli in the text (long lists of stimuli may be better presented in a table, where quotation marks are not needed)

The stimulus words were “garden,” “laundry,” “briefcase,” and “salary.”

Note: Some publishers prefer italics for the presentation of stimuli and so forth; consult the manuscript preparation guidelines or
journal editor for the preferred format.

to  reproduce  material  from  a  test  item  or  verbatim  instructions  to  participants  (if  instructions  are  long,  present  them  in  an
appendix or set them off from text in block quote format without quotation marks; see Sections 2.14 and 8.27)

The first item was “How tired do you feel after a long day at work?”

Participants read, “You can write as much as you like when answering the questions.”

to  introduce  a  word  or  phrase  used  as  an  ironic  comment,  as  slang,  or  as  an  invented  or  coined  expression;  use  quotation
marks only for the first occurrence of the word or phrase, not for subsequent occurrences

First occurrence:

considered “normal” behavior

called a “friendly link”

Subsequent occurrence:

normal behavior

a friendly link

to introduce a label; after the label has been used once, do not use quotation marks for subsequent occurrences

The image label changed from "spiderweb” to “dartboard.” The spiderweb and dartboard labels . . .

Note: (When a complete sentence is enclosed in parentheses, like this, place the end punctuation inside the parentheses.) If only part
of a sentence is enclosed in parentheses, place punctuation outside the parentheses (like this).

Do not use parentheses in the following cases:

to enclose text within other parentheses; instead, use square brackets to avoid nested parentheses

Incorrect: (e.g., flow) (Csikszentmihalyi, 2014)

6.9 Square Brackets
Use square brackets in the following cases:

to enclose parenthetical material that is already in parentheses

(The results for the control group [n = 8] are also presented in Figure 2.)

to enclose abbreviations when the abbreviated term appears in parentheses

(Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory–2 [MMPI-2]; Butcher et al., 2001)

Incorrect: in the first study (F[1, 32] = 4.37, p = .045).
Incorrect: in the first study [F(1, 32) = 4.37, p = .045].

Note: In mathematical material, the placement of brackets and parentheses is reversed; that is, parentheses appear within brackets
(see Section 6.46).

commas (see Section 8.11)

Correct: (as Gregory, 2020, concluded . . . )
Incorrect: (as Gregory [2020] concluded . . . )

6.10 Slash
Use a slash (also called a “virgule,” “solidus,” or “shill”) in the following cases:

to  clarify  a  comparison  in  a  compound  adjective,  especially  when  one  of  the  elements  is  a  hyphenated  compound
(alternatively, use an en dash; see Section 6.6)

Spelling

6.11 Preferred Spelling

Spelling in APA Style papers should conform to the Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary (https://www.merriam-webster.com). The
spellings  of  psychological  terms  should  conform  to  the  APA  Dictionary  of  Psychology  (https://dictionary.apa.org).  If  a  word
appears differently in these two dictionaries, follow the spelling in the APA Dictionary of Psychology. If a word is not in either of
these  dictionaries,  consult  an  unabridged  edition  of  Webster’s dictionary  (see  https://unabridged.merriam-webster.com).  If  the
dictionary offers a choice of spellings, select one and use it consistently throughout your paper.

The plural forms of some words of Latin or Greek origin can be troublesome (particularly those that end in the letter “a”). A

list of preferred spellings of some of the more common ones follows.

Singular:
Plural:

appendix
appendices

criterion
criteria

curriculum
curricula

datum
data

phenomenon
phenomena

Remember that plural nouns take plural verbs.

Correct: The data indicate

Incorrect: The data indicates

In general, form the possessive of a singular name by adding an apostrophe and an “s” (e.g., “Milner’s theory”). This guideline
also applies when a name ends in “s” (e.g., “Descartes’s philosophy,” “James’s work”).

The  spellings  of  terms  related  to  technology  evolve  over  time.  Use  the  following  spellings  for  some  common  technology

words in APA Style papers:

email

data set

Wi-Fi

home page

ebook

smartphone

website

username

ereader

internet

webpage

database

intranet

the web

login page (but “log in”
when used as a verb)

emoji (for the plural, either
“emoji” or “emojis”)

6.12 Hyphenation
Compound words—words composed of two or more words—take many forms; they may be written as (a) two separate words
(open), (b) one hyphenated word, or (c) one solid word. Compound words are often introduced into the language as separate or
hyphenated  words;  as  they  become  more  commonplace,  they  tend  to  fuse  into  a  solid  word.  For  example,  “data  base”  has
become “database,” and “e-mail” has become “email.” The dictionary is an excellent guide for choosing the proper form: When
a compound appears in the dictionary, its usage is established, and it is considered a permanent compound (e.g., “health care,”
“self-esteem,” “caregiver”). In general, follow the hyphenation shown in the dictionary for permanent compounds (e.g., write
“health  care”  without  a  hyphen,  even  in  a  phrase  like  “health  care  setting”);  adjust  hyphenation  only  to  prevent  misreading.
Dictionaries do not always agree on the way a compound should be written (open, hyphenated, or solid); Section 6.11 specifies
the dictionaries to use for APA Style papers.

Another form of compound—the temporary compound—is made up of two or more words that occur together, perhaps only
in a particular paper, to express a thought. Temporary compounds are not usually listed in the dictionary. To determine how to
hyphenate temporary compounds, follow these guidelines:

If  a  temporary  compound  can  be  misread  or  expresses  a  single  thought,  use  a  hyphen,  especially  when  the  temporary
compound  appears  as  an  adjective  before  the  noun.  When  in  doubt,  use  a  hyphen  for  clarity.  For  example,  “Adolescents
resided in two parent homes” may mean that two homes served as residences or that each adolescent lived with two parents; a
hyphen in “two-parent homes” specifies the latter meaning.

166

If the compound appears after the noun it modifies, do not use a hyphen because, in almost all cases, the phrase is sufficiently
clear without one. See Table 6.1 for further examples of hyphen use in temporary compounds.

Write most words formed with prefixes and suffixes as one word without a hyphen. See Table 6.2 for examples of prefixes
and suffixes that do not require hyphens; see Table 6.3 for examples of prefixed and suffixed words that do require hyphens.
The  same  suffix  may  be  hyphenated  in  some  cases  and  not  in  others  (e.g.,  “nationwide”  and  “worldwide”  vs.  “industry-
wide”).

When two or more compound modifiers have a common base, that base is sometimes omitted in all except the last modifier,
but the hyphens are retained. Leave a space after the hyphen when the base has been omitted, unless punctuation follows the
hyphen.

Capitalization

APA Style is a “down” style, meaning that words are lowercase unless there is specific guidance to capitalize them, as described
in the following sections.

6.13 Words Beginning a Sentence
Capitalize the following:

the first word in a complete sentence

the first word after a colon if what follows the colon is a complete sentence

The statement was emphatic: Further research is needed.

Do not capitalize the following:

a personal name that begins with a lowercase letter when the name begins a sentence; alternatively, reword the sentence

. . . after the test. van de Vijver et al. (2019) concluded

a proper noun (other than a personal name) that begins with a lowercase letter (e.g., iPad, eBay) or a lowercase statistical term
(e.g., t test, p value)  when  it  begins  a  sentence  (see  Section 6.26);  instead,  reword  the  sentence  to  avoid  beginning  with  a
lowercase letter

6.14 Proper Nouns and Trade Names
Capitalize the following:

proper nouns and proper adjectives

names of racial and ethnic groups (see also Section 5.7)

We interviewed 25 Black women living in rural Louisiana.

names of specific university departments, academic institutions, and academic courses

President Lincoln was elected in 1860.

Executive Director of Marketing Carolina Espinoza led the meeting.

Dr. Aisha Singh, Dr. Singh

Registered Nurse Paul T. Lo, Nurse Lo

Do not capitalize a job title or position when the title follows the name or refers to a position in general:

6.17 Titles of Works and Headings Within Works
APA Style uses two types of capitalization for titles of works and headings within works: title case and sentence case. In title
case,  major  words  are  capitalized.  In  sentence  case,  most  words  are  lowercased.  Nouns,  verbs  (including  linking  verbs),
adjectives,  adverbs,  pronouns,  and  all  words  of  four  letters  or  more  are  considered  major  words.  Short  (i.e.,  three  letters  or
fewer) conjunctions, short prepositions, and all articles are considered minor words.

Title Case. In title case, capitalize the following words in a title or heading:

the first word, even a minor word such as “The”

the first word of a subtitle, even if it is a minor word

the first word after a colon, em dash, or end punctuation in a heading, even if it is a minor word

major words, including the second part of hyphenated major words (e.g., “Self-Report,” not “Self-report”)

words of four letters or more (e.g., “With,” “Between,” “From”)

Lowercase only minor words that are three letters or fewer in a title or heading (except the first word in a title or subtitle or the
first word after a colon, em dash, or end punctuation in a heading):

short conjunctions (e.g., “and,” “as,” “but,” “for,” “if,” “nor,” “or,” “so,” “yet”)

articles (“a,” “an,” “the”)

short prepositions (e.g., “as,” “at,” “by,” “for,” “in,” “of,” “off,” “on,” “per,” “to,” “up,” “via”)

When to Use Title Case. Use title case for the following:

titles of articles, books, reports, and other works appearing in text

In the book Bilingualism Across the Lifespan: Factors Moderating Language Proficiency

In the article “Media Influences on Self-Stigma of Seeking Psychological Services: The Importance of Media Portrayals and Person
Perception”

titles of tests or measures, including subscales (see Section 6.18)

Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale

WAIS-IV Verbal Comprehension Index

all headings within a work (Levels 1–5; see Section 2.27)

the title of your own paper and of named sections and subsections within it

the Data Analyses section

titles of periodicals (these are also italicized)

The Washington Post

table titles (these are also italicized; see Section 7.11)

171

figure titles (these are also italicized), axis labels, and legends (see Sections 7.25–7.27)

Sentence Case. In sentence case, lowercase most words in the title or heading. Capitalize only the following words:

the first word of the title or heading
the first word of a subtitle
the first word after a colon, em dash, or end punctuation in a heading
nouns followed by numerals or letters
proper nouns

When to Use Sentence Case. Use sentence case for the following:

titles of articles, books, reports, webpages, and other works in reference list entries, even if title case was used in the original
work (see also Section 9.19)

table column headings, entries, and notes (see Sections 7.12–7.14)

figure notes (see Section 7.28)

Note: Words in the image of a figure (see Section 7.26) may be in either title case or sentence case. Follow the same guidelines for
capitalization in a figure image as used in the text.

6.18 Titles of Tests and Measures
Capitalize titles of published and unpublished tests and measures and their subscales. Do not capitalize words such as “test” and
“scale” unless they are part of the test or subscale title. See Section 10.11 for more on use of italics with the titles of test and
measures.

Italics

6.22 Use of Italics

Use italics for the following:

key terms or phrases, often accompanied by a definition

Mindfulness  is  defined  as  “the  act  of  noticing  new  things,  a  process  that  promotes  flexible  responding  to  the  demands  of  the
environment” (Pagnini et al., 2016, p. 91).

Note: Use italics for a term or phrase only once, when it is most appropriate to draw readers’ attention to the term or phrase;
elsewhere, the term should be in standard (nonitalic) type. For example, if a word is used in a heading and then defined in the text
that follows, italicize the term as part of the definition rather than in the heading.

Incorrect: It is important to bear in mind that this process is not proposed as a stage theory of development.

Note: Italics for emphasis are acceptable if emphasis might otherwise be lost or the material misread; in general, however, use
syntax to provide emphasis. See Section 8.31 for how to add emphasis in quoted material. Italics and bold may be used for
emphasis in tables, depending on the requirements of the journal (e.g., to show factor loadings of a particular size; see Table 7.14
in Section 7.21).

6.23 Reverse Italics
When words that would normally be italicized appear within text that is already italicized, those words should be set in standard
(nonitalic) type, referred to as reverse italicization. For example, when the title of a book contains the title of another book, use
standard type for the title within the title. In the text, use title case for both titles; in the reference list entry, use sentence case for
both  titles.  In  the  following  example,  Marinelli  and  Mayer  wrote  a  book  about  Freud’s  book  The  Interpretation  of  Dreams;
Marinelli and Mayer’s book title is italicized, and Freud’s book title within it is written in standard type.

movement. Other Press.

Abbreviations

An abbreviation is a shortened form of a word or phrase; abbreviations of phrases are often composed of the first letter of each
word of the phrase (i.e., acronym). To maximize clarity, use abbreviations sparingly and consider readers’ familiarity with the
abbreviation.

6.24 Use of Abbreviations
Although abbreviations can be useful for long, technical terms in scholarly writing, communication is often garbled rather than
clarified if an abbreviation is unfamiliar to readers. In general, use an abbreviation if (a) it is conventional and readers are likely
to be more familiar with the abbreviation than with the complete form and (b) considerable space can be saved and cumbersome
repetition avoided. For example, the abbreviations “L” for large and “S” for small in a paper describing different sequences of
reward (LLSS or LSLS) would be effective and readily understood shortcuts. In another paper, however, writing about the “L
reward”  and  the  “S  reward”  might  be  both  unnecessary  and  confusing.  In  most  instances,  abbreviating  experimental  group
names  is  ineffective  because  the  abbreviations  are  not  adequately  informative  or  easily  recognizable;  some  are  more

175

cumbersome than the full name. For the same reason, do not use the abbreviations “S,” “E,” and “O” for subject, experimenter,
and observer in the text.

Overuse. Sometimes  the  space  saved  by  using  abbreviations  is  not  justified  by  the  time  necessary  for  readers  to  master  the
meaning, as in the following example:

The advantage of the LH was clear from the RT data, which reflected high FP and FN rates for the RH.

Without abbreviations, the previous passage reads as follows:

The advantage of the left hand was clear from the reaction time data, which reflected high false-positive and false-negative rates for
the right hand.

Although there is no absolute limit for the use of abbreviations, writing is generally easier to understand when most words are
written out rather than when overflowing with abbreviations.

Underuse. In general, if you abbreviate a term, use the abbreviation at least three times in a paper. If you use the abbreviation
only  one  or  two  times,  readers  may  have  difficulty  remembering  what  it  means,  so  writing  the  term  out  each  time  aids
comprehension. However, a standard abbreviation for a long, familiar term is clearer and more concise even if it is used fewer
than three times.

6.25 Definition of Abbreviations
In APA Style papers, do not define abbreviations that are listed as terms in the dictionary (e.g., AIDS, IQ). Also do not define
measurement abbreviations (see Section 6.27), time abbreviations (see Section 6.28), Latin abbreviations (see Section 6.29), or
many statistical abbreviations (see Section 6.44). Define all other abbreviations, even those that may be familiar to your readers
(e.g., “RT” for reaction time or “ANOVA” for analysis of variance; see also Section 6.24). After you define an abbreviation, use
only the abbreviation; do not alternate between spelling out the term and abbreviating it.

Definition in the Text. When you first use a term that you want to abbreviate in the text, present both the full version of the term
and the abbreviation.

When the full version of a term appears for the first time in a heading, do not define the abbreviation in the heading; instead
define the abbreviation when the full version next appears. Use abbreviations in headings only if the abbreviations have been
previously defined in the text or if they are listed as terms in the dictionary.

When the full version of a term first appears in a sentence in the text, place the abbreviation in parentheses after it.

attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)

When the full version of a term first appears in parenthetical text, place the abbreviation in square brackets after it. Do not use
nested parentheses.

(i.e., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD])

If a citation accompanies an abbreviation, include the citation after the abbreviation, separated with a semicolon. Do not use
nested or back-to-back parentheses.

Beck Depression Inventory–II (BDI-II; Beck et al., 1996)

(Beck Depression Inventory–II [BDI-II]; Beck et al., 1996)

Definition  in  Tables  and  Figures.  Define  abbreviations  used  in  tables  and  figures  within  each  table  and  figure,  even  if  the
abbreviations have already been defined in the text. The abbreviation can appear in parentheses after first use of the term within
the table or figure, including in the table or figure title, or the definition can appear in a table or figure general note or a figure
legend. If an abbreviation is used in multiple tables and figures, define it in each table or figure. Do not define abbreviations that
do not appear in a table or figure. Do not define or write out standard abbreviations for units of measurement and statistics in a
table or figure (see Sections 6.44 and 7.15).

6.26 Format of Abbreviations

176

Plural  Forms.  To  form  the  plural  of  most  abbreviations  and  statistical  symbols,  add  a  lowercase  “s”  alone,  without  an
apostrophe.

IQs  DOIs  URLs  Eds.  vols.  Ms  ps  ns  ESs

Note: To form the plural of the reference abbreviation for “page” (p.), write “pp.” Do not add an “s” to make abbreviations for units of
measurement plural.

3 cm (not 3 cms)      24 hr (not 24 hrs)

Abbreviations Beginning a Sentence. Never  begin  a  sentence  with  a  lowercase  abbreviation  (e.g.,  lb)  or  with  a  stand-alone
symbol (e.g., α). Begin a sentence with a symbol connected to a word (e.g., β-Endorphins) only when necessary to avoid indirect
or awkward phrasing. When a chemical compound begins a sentence, capitalize the first letter of the word to which the symbol
is connected; keep the locant, descriptor, or positional prefix (i.e., Greek, small capital, and italic letters and numerals) intact.

In running text:
L-methionine
N, N′-dimethylurea
γ-hydroxy-β-aminobutyric acid

At beginning of sentence:
L-Methionine
N, N′-Dimethylurea
γ-Hydroxy-β-aminobutyric acid

6.27 Unit of Measurement Abbreviations
Metrication. APA uses the metric system in its journals. If you used instruments that record measurements in nonmetric units,
report the nonmetric units followed by the established metric equivalents in parentheses.

Measurement in metric units:
The rods were spaced 19 mm apart.

Measurement in nonmetric units with the rounded metric equivalent:
The rod was 3 ft (0.91 m) long.

Presentation. Write out the full names of units of measurement that are not accompanied by numeric values.

several kilograms  age in years  duration of hours  centimeters

Use  abbreviations  and  symbols  for  units  of  measurement  that  are  accompanied  by  numeric  values;  do  not  make  symbols  or
abbreviations of units plural.

4 cm  30 kg  12 min  18 hr  22 °C

Also use the abbreviation or symbol in column and row (stub) headings of tables to conserve space, even when the term appears
without a numeric value.

lag in ms

Do  not  define  or  spell  out  unit  of  measurement  abbreviations,  even  the  first  time  they  are  used.  See  Table  6.4  for  a  list  of
abbreviations  for  common  units  of  measurement  (for  statistical  symbols  and  abbreviations,  including  percentages  and  money
symbols, see Section 6.44).

Note. These abbreviations do not need to be defined when they are used in a paper.
a Include the metric unit equivalent in parentheses when using nonmetric units.

Capitalization and Spelling. In most cases, use lowercase letters for symbols (e.g., kg), even in capitalized material. However,
the following are exceptions:

178

Symbols derived from the name of a person usually include uppercase letters (e.g., Gy).

Symbols for prefixes that represent powers of 10 are usually written in uppercase letters: exa (E), peta (P), tera (T), giga (G),
and mega (M).

Use the symbol “L” for liter when it stands alone (e.g., 5 L, 0.3 mg/L) because a lowercase “l” may be misread as the numeral
1 (use lowercase “l” for fractions of a liter: 5 ml, 9 ng/dl).

Do not use a period after a symbol, except at the end of a sentence. An exception is to include a period after the abbreviation for
“inch” (in.), which could be misread without the period.

Use a space between a symbol and the number to which it refers (e.g., degrees, minutes, and seconds). An exception is the

measure of angles, in which case the symbol is written without a space after the measurement.

4.5 m  6 hr  12 °C  but  45° angle

Repeated Units of Measurement. Do not repeat abbreviated units of measurement when expressing multiple amounts.

16–30 kHz  0.3, 1.5, and 3.0 mg/dl

When reporting related statistics, such as means and standard deviations, report the unit with the main statistic but do not repeat
it for the related statistic(s) when the unit remains the same.

Correct: (M = 8.7 years, SD = 2.3)
Incorrect: (M = 8.7 years, SD = 2.3 years)

Compound Units. Use a centered dot between the symbols of a compound term formed by the multiplication of units.

Pa • s

Use a space between the full names of units of a compound unit formed by the multiplication of units; do not use a centered dot.

pascal second

6.28 Time Abbreviations
To prevent misreading, do not abbreviate the words “day,” “week,” “month,” and “year,” even when they are accompanied by
numeric values. Do abbreviate the words “hour,” “minute,” “second,” “millisecond,” “nanosecond,” and any other division of
the second when they are accompanied by numeric values.

6.29 Latin Abbreviations
Use the following standard Latin abbreviations only in parenthetical material; in the narrative, use the translation of the Latin
term. In both cases, punctuate as if the abbreviation were spelled out in the language in which you are writing.

179

Latin abbreviation

e.g.,

that is,

namely,

versus or against

Exceptions: Use the abbreviation “v.” (for “versus”) in the title or name of a court case in the reference list and in all in-text
citations (see Section 11.4). Use the Latin abbreviation “et al.” (which means “and others”) in both narrative and parenthetical
citations (see Section 8.17). (The abbreviation “ibid.” is not used in APA Style.)

6.30 Chemical Compound Abbreviations
Chemical compounds may be expressed by the common name or the chemical name. If you prefer to use the common name,
provide the chemical name in parentheses on first mention. Avoid expressing compounds with chemical formulas because these
are  usually  less  informative  to  readers  and  have  a  high  likelihood  of  being  typed  or  typeset  incorrectly  (e.g.,  “aspirin”  or
“salicylic acid,” not “C9H8O4”).  If  names  of  compounds  include  Greek  letters,  retain  the  letters  as  symbols  and  do  not  write
them out (e.g., “β carotene,” not “beta carotene”). If a compound name containing a Greek letter appears at the beginning of a
sentence, capitalize the first letter of the word to which the symbol is connected (see Section 6.26).

Long names of organic compounds are often abbreviated. If the abbreviation is listed as a term in a dictionary (see Section

6.25; e.g., “NADP” for “nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate”), you do not need to write it out in full on first use.

Concentrations.  If  you  express  a  solution  as  a  percentage  concentration  instead  of  as  a  molar  concentration,  specify  the
percentage as a weight-per-volume ratio (wt/vol), a volume ratio (vol/vol), or a weight ratio (wt/wt) of solute to solvent. The
higher the concentration, the more ambiguous the expression is as a percentage. Specifying the ratio is especially necessary for
concentrations of alcohol, glucose, and sucrose. Specifying the salt form is also essential for precise reporting of d-amphetamine
HCl or d-amphetamine SO4 (expression of a chemical name in combination with a formula is acceptable in this case).

12% (vol/vol) ethyl alcohol solution
1% (wt/vol) saccharin solution

Routes of Administration. Abbreviate a route of administration when it is paired with a number-and-unit combination. Do not
use  periods  with  abbreviations  for  routes  of  administration:  icv  =  intracerebral  ventricular,  im  =  intramuscular,  ip  =
intraperitoneal, iv = intravenous, sc = subcutaneous, and so forth.

6.31 Gene and Protein Name Abbreviations
Writing  about  genes  can  be  challenging.  Each  gene  has  an  official  full  name  and  symbol,  designated  by  the  HUGO  Gene
Nomenclature  Committee,  that  describe  the  gene’s  function  or  location  and  often  the  protein  it  produces.  Use  standard  gene
names
Information
from
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene)  and  the  HUGO  Gene  Nomenclature  Committee  (https://www.genenames.org/).  Gene
names are organism specific (e.g., human, mouse), so use an appropriate database. Additionally, the same gene may be known
by  an  “alias”  (or  alternate  scientific,  informal,  and/or  historical)  name  and  symbol.  For  example,  the  glucocorticoid  receptor
gene, which is highly implicated in the response to stress, has the official name “nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member
1”;  has  the  official  symbol  NR3C1;  and  produces  GR  proteins;  it  is  also  commonly  known  as  the  “glucocorticoid  receptor,”
abbreviated “GR.” If a gene is known by more than one name or symbol, select one presentation and use it consistently; the first
time you mention a gene in your paper, you may also note the other name and/or symbol by which it is known to alert readers
who may not be familiar with the designation you chose. Also state whether you are referring to the gene or to its protein, and
use appropriate terminology (e.g., use “expression” when discussing genes and “levels” when discussing proteins).

Do  not  italicize  gene  names  written  out  in  full  (e.g.,  corticotropin-releasing  hormone)  and  gene  proteins  (e.g.,  CRH).
However, do italicize gene symbols (e.g., CRH). It is not required to abbreviate the full name of a gene and to use its symbol;
follow  the  guidelines  in  Section 6.24  if  you  are  considering  using  an  abbreviation  for  a  gene.  For  further  discussion  of  gene
names and formatting, see Wain et al. (2002) and the International Committee on Standardized Genetic Nomenclature for Mice
and Rat Genome and Nomenclature Committee (2018).

Numbers

In general, use numerals to express numbers 10 and above and words to express numbers below 10. Consider on a case-by-case
basis whether to follow the general guideline or if an exception applies.

6.32 Numbers Expressed in Numerals
Use numerals to express the following:

numbers 10 and above throughout the paper, including the abstract (for exceptions, see Sections 6.33–6.34) and both cardinal
and ordinal numbers (see Section 6.35)

6.33 Numbers Expressed in Words
Use words to express the following:

numbers zero through nine (except as described in Sections 6.32 and 6.34) in the text, including the abstract

any number that begins a sentence, title, or heading (when possible, reword the sentence to avoid beginning with a number)

However, if this makes the text more difficult for readers, consider rewording the sentence.

6.35 Ordinal Numbers
Treat ordinal numbers as you would cardinal numbers.

The  suffixes  of  ordinal  numbers  can  be  presented  with  or  without  a  superscript  (e.g.,  either  4th  or  4th),  but  be  consistent  in
presentation throughout your paper.

6.36 Decimal Fractions
Use a zero before the decimal point in numbers that are less than 1 when the statistic can exceed 1.

t(20) = 0.86
Cohen’s d = 0.70

F(1, 27) = 0.57
0.48 cm

Do not use a zero before a decimal fraction when the statistic cannot be greater than 1 (e.g., correlations, proportions, levels of
statistical significance).

r(24) = –.43, p = .028

The number of decimal places to use in reporting the results of experiments and data-analytic manipulations should be governed
by the following principle: Round as much as possible while considering prospective use and statistical precision. As a general
rule, fewer decimal digits are easier to comprehend than are more digits; therefore, it is usually better to round to two decimal
places  or  to  rescale  the  measurement  (in  which  case  effect  sizes  should  be  presented  in  the  same  metric).  For  instance,  a
difference in distances that must be carried to four decimals to be seen when scaled in meters can be more effectively illustrated
in millimeters, which would require only a few decimal digits to illustrate the same difference.

When  properly  scaled,  most  data  can  be  effectively  presented  with  two  decimal  digits  of  accuracy.  Report  correlations,
proportions,  and  inferential  statistics  such  as  t, F, and  chi-square  to  two  decimals.  When  reporting  data  measured  on  integer

182

scales (as with many questionnaires), report means and standard deviations to one decimal place (as group measures, they are
more  stable  than  individual  scores).  Report  exact p values  (e.g.,  p =  .031)  to  two  or  three  decimal  places.  However,  report  p
values less than .001 as p < .001. The tradition of reporting p values in the form of p < .10, p < .05, p < .01, and so forth was
appropriate in a time when only limited tables of critical values were available. However, in tables the “p <” notation may be
necessary for clarity (see Section 7.14). For guidance on the types of statistics to report in your paper, see the reporting standards
for quantitative methods and results (Sections 3.6–3.7).

6.37 Roman Numerals
If Roman numerals are part of an established terminology, do not change them to Arabic numerals. For example, use “Type II
error,” not “Type 2 error.” Use Arabic numerals for routine seriation (e.g., Step 1, Experiment 2, Study 3).

6.38 Commas in Numbers
Use commas between groups of three digits in most figures of 1,000 or more. Some exceptions are as follows:

Category

Example of exception

page numbers

binary digits

serial numbers

degrees of temperature

acoustic frequency designations

degrees of freedom

6.39 Plurals of Numbers
To form the plurals of numbers, whether expressed as numerals or as words, add “s” or “es” alone, without an apostrophe.

twos and sixes   the 1960s   30s and 40s

Statistical and Mathematical Copy

APA Style for presenting statistical and mathematical copy reflects (a) the standards of content and form agreed on in the field
and (b) the requirements of clear communication. The Publication Manual addresses standards for presentation only; it does not
provide  guidance  on  how  to  choose  statistics,  conduct  analyses,  or  interpret  results.  Consult  a  statistics  reference  work  or  a
statistician for help if needed.

6.40 Selecting Effective Presentation
Statistical  and  mathematical  copy  can  be  presented  in  text,  in  tables,  and/or  in  figures.  In  deciding  which  approach  to  take,
follow these general guidelines:

If you need to present three or fewer numbers, first try using a sentence.

If you need to present four to 20 numbers, first try using a table.

If you need to present more than 20 numbers, first try using a figure.

Select  the  mode  of  presentation  that  optimizes  readers’  understanding  of  the  data.  Detailed  displays  that  allow  fine-grained
understanding of a data set may be more appropriate to include in supplemental materials (see Section 2.15)  than  in  the  print
version  of  an  article.  However,  editors  publish  tables  and  figures  at  their  discretion;  they  may  also  request  new  tables  and
figures.

6.41 References for Statistics

183

Do  not  provide  a  reference  for  a  statistic  in  common  use  (e.g.,  Cohen’s  d);  this  convention  applies  to  most  statistics  used  in
journal  articles.  Provide  a  reference  when  (a)  less  common  statistics  are  used,  (b)  a  statistic  is  used  in  an  unconventional  or
controversial way, or (c) the statistic itself is the focus of the paper.

6.42 Formulas
Do  not  provide  a  formula  for  a  statistic  in  common  use;  however,  provide  a  formula  when  the  statistic  or  mathematical
expression is new, rare, or essential to the paper. The presentation of equations is described in Sections 6.46 and 6.47.

6.43 Statistics in Text
When reporting inferential statistics (e.g., t tests, F tests, chi-square tests, and associated effect sizes and confidence intervals),
include sufficient information to allow readers to fully understand the analyses conducted. The data supplied, preferably in the
text but possibly in supplemental materials depending on the magnitude of the data arrays, should allow readers to confirm the
basic reported analyses (e.g., cell means, standard deviations, sample sizes, correlations) and should enable interested readers to
construct some effect-size estimates and confidence intervals beyond those supplied in the paper per se. In the case of multilevel
data, present summary statistics for each level of aggregation. What constitutes sufficient information depends on the analytic
approach reported.

F ratios:
For immediate recognition, the omnibus test of the main effect of sentence format was significant, F(2, 177) = 6.30, p = .002, est ω2 =

t values:
The one-degree-of-freedom contrast of primary interest was significant at the specified p < .05 level, t(177) = 3.51, p < .001, d = 0.65,
95% CI [0.35, 0.95].

Hierarchical and other sequential regression statistics:
High school GPA predicted college mathematics performance, R2 = .12, F(1, 148) = 20.18, p < .001, 95% CI [.02, .22].

If you present descriptive statistics in a table or figure, do not repeat them in the text, although you should (a) mention the table
in which the statistics can be found in the text and (b) emphasize particular data in the text when they aid in the interpretation of
the findings.

When enumerating a series of similar statistics, be certain that the relation between the statistics and their referents is clear.

Words such as “respectively” and “in order” can clarify this relationship.

Means  (with  standard  deviations  in  parentheses)  for  Trials  1–4  were  2.43  (0.50),  2.59  (1.21),  2.68  (0.39),  and  2.86  (0.12),
respectively.

When reporting confidence intervals, use the format 95% CI [LL, UL], where LL is the lower limit of the confidence interval and
UL is the upper limit. Every report of a confidence interval must clearly state the level of confidence. However, when confidence
intervals are repeated in a series or within the same paragraph, the level of confidence (e.g., 95%) has remained unchanged, and
the meaning is clear, do not repeat “95% CI.”

95% CIs [5.62, 8.31], [–2.43, 4.31], and [–4.29, –3.11], respectively

When a confidence interval follows the report of a point estimate, do not repeat the units of measurement.

M = 30.5 cm, 99% CI [18.0, 43.0]

6.44 Statistical Symbols and Abbreviations
Symbols and abbreviations are often used for statistics (e.g., “mean” is abbreviated “M”). Table 6.5 contains common statistical
abbreviations and symbols.

Do not define symbols or abbreviations that represent statistics (e.g., M, SD, F, t, df, p, N, n, OR, r) or any abbreviations or
symbols composed of Greek letters (e.g., α, β, χ2) in Table 6.5.
However, define the other abbreviations in Table 6.5 (e.g., AIC, ANOVA, BIC, CFA, CI, NFI, RMSEA, SEM) when they are
used anywhere in your paper (see Sections 6.25 and 7.14–7.15).

Note. It is acceptable to use the form est(θ) or

Some  terms  are  used  as  both  abbreviations  and  symbols.  Use  the  abbreviation  when  referring  to  the  concept  and  the  symbol
when  specifying  a  numeric  value.  The  symbol  form  will  usually  be  either  a  non-English  letter  or  an  italicized  English  letter.
Most  abbreviations  can  be  turned  into  symbols  (for  use  when  reporting  numerical  estimates)  by  simply  italicizing  the
abbreviation.

Note: Some quantitative approaches (e.g., structural equation modeling) use multiple notation systems; any notation system is
acceptable as long as it is used consistently. If you use a notation system other than the one shown in Table 6.5, identify it for readers.
Do not mix notation systems within a paper.

As  with  all  aspects  of  paper  preparation,  ensure  that  there  are  no  ambiguities  that  could  lead  to  errors  in  final  production,
particularly  with  mathematical  and  statistical  symbols,  unusual  characters,  and  complex  alignments  (e.g.,  subscripts,
superscripts). Avoid misunderstandings and corrections by preparing mathematical copy carefully.

Symbols Versus Words. When using a statistical term in narrative text, use the term, not the symbol. For example, state “the
means were” not “the Ms were.” When using a statistical term in conjunction with a mathematical operator, use the symbol or
abbreviation. For example, write “(M = 7.74),” not “(mean = 7.74).”

Symbols  for  Population  Versus  Sample  Statistics.  Population  parameters  are  usually  represented  by  Greek  letters.  Most
estimators are represented by italicized Latin letters. For example, the population correlation would be represented as ρ, and the

188

estimator  would  be  represented  as r; est(ρ)  and
letters (e.g., t and F), and a few are represented by Greek letters (e.g., Γ).

  are  also  acceptable.  Some  test  statistics  are  represented  by  italicized  Latin

⍴̂

Symbols for Number of Subjects. Use an uppercase, italicized N to designate the number of members in the total sample (e.g.,
N = 135). Use a lowercase, italicized n to designate the number of members in a limited portion or subsample of the total sample
(e.g., n = 80 in the treatment group).

Symbols for Percentage and Currency. Use the percent symbol and currency symbols only when they are accompanied by a
numeral; also use them in table headings and in figure labels and legends to conserve space. Use the word “percentage” or the
name of the currency when a number is not given. Repeat the symbol for a range of percentages or quantities of currency.

18%–20%

Standard, Bold, and Italic Type. Statistical symbols and mathematical information in papers are prepared with three different
type styles: standard (roman), bold, and italic. The same type style is used in text, tables, and figures.

Use standard type for Greek letters, subscripts and superscripts that function as identifiers (i.e., are not variables, as in the
subscript “girls” in the example that follows), and abbreviations that are not variables (e.g., log, GLM, WLS).

μgirls, α, βi

Use bold type for symbols for vectors and matrices.

V, Σ

Use italic type for all other statistical symbols.

N, Mx, df, SSE, MSE, t, F

On occasion, an element may serve as both an abbreviation and a symbol (e.g., SD); in this case, use the type style that reflects
the function of the element (see Table 6.5).

6.45 Spacing, Alignment, and Punctuation for Statistics
Space mathematical copy as you would space words: a+b=c is as difficult to read as wordswithoutspacing. Instead, type a + b =
c. For a minus sign indicating subtraction, use a space on each side of the sign (e.g., z – y = x); for a minus sign indicating a
negative value, use a space before but not after the sign (e.g., –8.25).

Note: A minus sign is a different typographical character than a hyphen (it is longer and slightly higher); your word-processing program
has options for inserting a minus sign in your paper.

Align signs and symbols carefully. Use the subscript and superscript functions of your word-processing program. In most cases,
2). However, place a subscript or superscript such as the symbol for prime right next
type subscripts first and then superscripts (xa
to its letter or symbol (x'a). Because APA prefers to align subscripts and superscripts one under the other (“stacking”) for ease of
reading instead of setting one to the right of the other (“staggering”), if you are publishing an article that includes statistics in an
APA journal, your subscripts and superscripts will be stacked when they are typeset. If subscripts and superscripts should not be
stacked, indicate this in a cover letter or in the manuscript.

Presentation of Equations

Punctuate all equations, whether they are in the line of text or displayed (i.e., typed on a separate line), to conform to their place
in the syntax of the sentence (see the period following Equation 3 in Section 6.47). If your paper will be typeset and you have an
equation that exceeds the column width of a typeset page, indicate in the accepted manuscript where breaks would be acceptable.

189

6.46 Equations in Text
Place short and simple equations, such as a = [(1 + b)/x]1/2, in the line of text. To present fractions in the line of text, use a slash
(/). To make the order of operations in an equation visually unambiguous, use parentheses, square brackets, and braces (together
referred to as “fences”). Use parentheses first to enclose material; use square brackets to enclose material already in parentheses;
and use braces (curly brackets) to enclose material already in square brackets and parentheses: first ( ), then [( )], and finally {[(
)]}.

Equations  in  the  line  of  text  should  not  project  above  or  below  the  line;  for  example,  the  equation  at  the  beginning  of  this

section would be difficult to set in the line of text if it were in this form:

Instead, such equations are displayed on their own line (see Section 6.47).

6.47 Displayed Equations
Display  simple  equations  if  they  must  be  numbered  for  later  reference.  Display  all  complex  equations.  Number  all  displayed
equations consecutively, with the number in parentheses near the right margin of the page.

When referring to numbered equations, include the full word “equation” (e.g., “Equation 3” or “the third equation,” not “Eq. 3”).

6.48 Preparing Statistical and Mathematical Copy for Publication
Display  all  mathematical  signs  and  symbols  in  typed  form,  when  possible.  If  a  character  cannot  be  produced  by  your  word-
processing program, insert it as an image. Type fences (i.e., parentheses, brackets, and braces), uppercase and lowercase letters,
punctuation, subscripts and superscripts, and all other elements exactly as you want them to appear in the published article.

Lists

6.49 List Guidelines

Just  as  heading  structure  alerts  readers  to  the  order  of  ideas  in  a  paper,  seriation—that  is,  lists—helps  readers  understand  a
related set of key points within a sentence or paragraph. In a series, all items should be syntactically and conceptually parallel
(see Section 4.24 for a more detailed discussion of parallelism).

When a list within a sentence contains three or more items, use a serial comma before the final item (see also Section 6.3).

Participants were similar with respect to age, gender, and ethnicity.

However, if any item in a list of three or more items already contains commas, use semicolons instead of commas between the
items (see Section 6.4).

We  were  interested  in  how  students  describe  their  gender  identities  and  expressions; their  perceptions  of  emotional  and  physical
safety  on  campus,  including  whether  and  how  such  perceptions  impact  their  gender  expression;  and  their  perceptions  of  trans-
affirming versus trans-negative reactions among fellow students and faculty.

6.50 Lettered Lists
Within a sentence or paragraph narrative, identify elements in a series with lowercase letters in parentheses when doing so will
help readers understand the separate, parallel items in a complex list. Lettered lists may also be used to draw attention to the
items—but  not  as  much  attention  as  a  numbered  or  bulleted  list.  Use  commas  or  semicolons  between  items  as  described  in
Section 6.49.

Our  sample  organization  used  a  waterfall  model  that  featured  the  following  sequential  stages:  (a)  requirements  analysis,  (b)
specification, (c) architecture, (d) design, and (e) deployment.

190

We  tested  three  groups:  (a)  low  scorers,  who  scored  fewer  than  20  points;  (b)  moderate  scorers,  who  scored  between  20  and  50
points; and (c) high scorers, who scored more than 50 points.

6.51 Numbered Lists
Use a numbered list to display complete sentences or paragraphs in a series (e.g., itemized conclusions, steps in a procedure).
Use a lettered or bulleted list rather than a numbered list if the items are phrases. Use the numbered list function of your word-
processing program to create the numbered list; this will automatically indent the list as well. Select the option for an Arabic
numeral followed by a period but not enclosed in or followed by parentheses. Capitalize the first word after the number (and the
first word in any subsequent sentence), and end each sentence with a period or other punctuation as appropriate.

We addressed the following research questions:

1. What research methodologies are used to examine the effects of cultural competency training?

2. How are psychologists trained to be culturally competent?

3. How are training outcomes assessed?

4. What are the outcomes of cultural competency training?

6.52 Bulleted Lists
The use of a numbered list may connote an unwanted or unwarranted ordinal position (e.g., chronology, importance, priority)
among the items. To achieve the same effect without the implication of ordinality, use bullets to identify the items in the series.
Use the bulleted list function of your word-processing program to create the bulleted list; this will automatically indent the list as
well.  Symbols  such  as  small  circles,  squares,  dashes,  and  so  forth  may  be  used  for  the  bullets.  When  an  article  accepted  for
publication is typeset, the bullet symbol will be changed to the style used by that journal.

Items That Are Complete Sentences. If bulleted list items are complete sentences, begin each sentence with a capital letter and
finish it with a period or other end punctuation.

There are several ways in which psychologists could apply social-media-driven methods to improve their work:

Social psychologists could use these methods to improve research on emotional experiences.

Community psychologists could use these methods to improve population assessment at the city level.

Clinical psychologists could use these methods to improve assessment or treatment.

Items That Are Phrases. If bulleted list items are phrases or sentence fragments (i.e., not full sentences), begin each bulleted
item  with  a  lowercase  letter  (for  exceptions,  such  as  proper  nouns,  see  Sections  6.14–6.21).  There  are  two  options  for
punctuating a bulleted list in which the items are phrases or fragments.

Phrases Without End Punctuation. The  first  option  is  to  use  no  punctuation  after  the  bulleted  items  (including  the  final  one),
which may be better when the items are shorter and simpler.

Some strategies used by faculty of color in the United States for survival and success on the tenure track include the following:

learning the rules of the game

being aware of who possesses power

working doubly hard

emphasizing one’s strengths and establishing some authority

finding White allies (Lutz et al., 2013; Turner et al., 2011)

Phrases With End Punctuation. The second option is to insert punctuation after the bulleted items as though the bullets were not
there, following the guidelines in Sections 6.3 and 6.4 for comma and semicolon usage; this option may be better when the items
are longer or more complex.

Adolescents may crave the opportunities for peer connection that social media affords because it allows them to

communicate privately with individuals or publicly with a larger audience,

seek affirmation by posting pictures or commentary and receiving likes or comments,

see how their numbers of friends and followers compare with those of their peers, and

191

monitor who is doing what with whom by seeing how many peers like and comment on their posts and comparing the feedback they
get with what others received (Underwood & Ehrenreich, 2017).

Items That Contain Both Phrases and Sentences. When bulleted items contain both phrases and sentences (as with a list of
definitions in a glossary), various formats are possible, but the presentation should be consistent and logical. One approach is to
lowercase the word or phrase at the beginning of the bullet in bold, followed by a colon. If what follows the colon is a sentence
fragment, lowercase the first word after the colon.

creativity: the ability to produce or develop original work, theories, techniques, or thoughts.

Use a period after a sentence fragment when an additional sentence follows the fragment; otherwise, the punctuation after the
fragment is optional.

goal: the end state toward which a human or nonhuman animal is striving. It can be identified by observing that an organism ceases
or changes its behavior upon attaining this state.

If what follows the colon is a complete sentence, capitalize the first word after the colon and end the sentence with a period or
other end punctuation.

problem solving: Individuals use problem solving to attempt to overcome difficulties, achieve plans that move them from a starting
situation to a desired goal, or reach conclusions through the use of higher mental functions, such as reasoning and creative thinking.

TA B LES A N D  FIGU R ES

Tables  and  figures  enable  authors  to  present  a  large  amount  of  information  efficiently  and  to  make  their  data  more
comprehensible. Tables usually show numerical values (e.g., means and standard deviations) or textual information (e.g., lists of
stimulus  words,  responses  from  participants)  arranged  in  an  orderly  display  of  columns  and  rows.  A  figure  may  be  a  chart,
graph, photograph, drawing, or any other illustration or nontextual depiction. At times, the boundary between tables and figures
may be unclear; in general, tables are characterized by a row–column structure, and any type of illustration or image other than a
table  is  considered  a  figure.  In  this  chapter,  we  discuss  the  purpose  of  tables  and  figures;  principles  for  designing,  preparing,
placing,  and  reproducing  them;  and  guidelines  for  creating  and  formatting  tables  and  figures  in  APA  Style,  with  examples  of
various types.

General Guidelines for Tables and Figures

7.1 Purpose of Tables and Figures

The primary purpose of any table or figure is to facilitate readers’ understanding of the work. For example, tables and figures
can be used to summarize information (e.g., a theoretical model, qualities of studies included in a meta-analysis), to present the
results of exploratory data analysis or data mining techniques (e.g., a factor analysis), to estimate some statistic or function (e.g.,
a nomograph), or to share full trial-level data (for more on data sharing, see Section 1.14). Although tables and figures attract
attention,  they  should  not  be  used  for  mere  decoration  in  an  academic  paper.  Instead,  every  table  and  figure  should  serve  a
purpose.

7.2 Design and Preparation of Tables and Figures
When  preparing  a  table  or  figure,  first  determine  the  purpose  of  the  display  and  the  relative  importance  of  that  purpose  (see
Section  7.1);  then,  select  a  format  that  supports  that  purpose  (see  Sections  7.21  and  7.36  for  sample  tables  and  figures,
respectively). For example, if the purpose is to illustrate a theoretical model, a chart is most likely the best option. Sometimes,
multiple approaches are possible; for example, if your goal is to present group scores, a table would allow readers to see each
group’s  exact  scores,  whereas  a  figure  would  emphasize  similarities  or  differences  between  groups.  When  possible,  use  a
standard, or canonical, form for a table or figure (examples are shown in Sections 7.21 and 7.36).

Design tables and figures with readers in mind. Communicate findings clearly while also creating attractive visual displays.
Prepare  tables  and  figures  with  the  same  care  as  the  text  of  the  paper;  changes  in  text  often  demand  changes  in  tables  and
figures, and a mismatch between data presented in the text versus in tables and figures may result in the need for a correction
notice  for  published  articles  or  in  a  lower  grade  for  student  assignments  if  the  error  is  not  corrected  before  publication  or
submission, respectively. Use the following principles when designing tables and figures:

Label all columns in tables.

Label all elements in figure images (e.g., label the axes of a graph).

Place items that are to be compared next to each other.

Place labels next to the elements they are labeling.

195

In figure images, use sans serif fonts that are large enough to be read without magnification.

Design the table or figure so it can be understood on its own (meaning readers do not have to refer to the text to understand
it).  Define  abbreviations  used  in  the  table  or  figure  even  if  they  are  also  defined  in  the  text  (see  Section  7.15  for  some
exceptions).

Tables or figures designated as supplemental materials should also contain enough information to be understood on their own.

Avoid decorative flourishes, which are distracting and can interfere with readers’ comprehension; instead, ensure that every
element supports the goal of effective communication.

7.3 Graphical Versus Textual Presentation
Be selective in choosing how many tables and figures to include in your paper. Readers may lose track of your message if there
are a large number of tables and figures; for example, if many tables and figures accompany a small amount of text, it can cause
problems  with  page  layout  for  published  articles.  Moreover,  graphical  presentation  is  not  always  optimal  for  effective
communication. For example, the results of a single statistical significance test or a few group means and standard deviations
can be presented in text.

The one-way ANOVA, F(1, 136) = 4.86, MSE = 3.97, p = .029, η2 = .03, demonstrated . . .
Scores on the insomnia measure (M = 4.08, SD = 0.22) were . . .

A table or figure is an effective choice to present the results of multiple statistical tests or many descriptive statistics (e.g., when
reporting the results of numerous analyses of variance [ANOVAs] or summarizing participant demographic data). It may also be
possible to combine several smaller tables or figures with similar content into one larger table or figure. Consider how the table
or figure augments or supplements the text. For example, when the components of a theoretical model are discussed in the text, a
figure  may  help  summarize  the  model;  the  value  of  the  figure  is  the  visual  summary.  However,  tables  or  figures  that  are
redundant with the text may be unnecessary.

7.4 Formatting Tables and Figures
Tables and figures follow the same structure: They have a table or figure number, a table or figure title, a body (for tables) or an
image  (for  figures),  and  table  or  figure  notes  as  needed.  Tables  and  figures  may  be  produced  in  many  different  file  formats;
publishers or instructors may limit the formats they accept.

Use the tables function of your word-processing program to create tables. If you copy and paste tables from another program
(e.g.,  SPSS,  Excel)  into  your  word-processing  program,  you  may  need  to  adjust  the  formatting  to  comply  with  APA  Style
guidelines. Do not use the tab key or space bar to manually create the look of a table; this approach is prone to alignment errors
and is especially problematic if the table will be typeset for publication.

Figures  can  be  created  in  a  variety  of  ways  using  many  programs,  such  as  Excel,  PowerPoint,  Photoshop,  Illustrator,
MATLAB, and Inkscape. Regardless of the program used to create the figure, the output should be of sufficient resolution to
produce  high-quality  images.  TIFF  and  EPS  files  are  recommended  for  figures  that  are  to  be  submitted  for  publication;  file
formats such as JPG or PNG are also acceptable for other works produced in APA Style (e.g., classroom assignments). Some
types of figures require higher resolution than others; for example, line art requires finer detail than a photograph. Ensure that
the format used supports the resolution needed for clear presentation of the image. Check the author guidelines for the journal or
publisher to which you are submitting your work for specifications (for APA journals, see the Journal Manuscript Preparation
Guidelines at http://on.apa.org/WDtxdW).

7.5 Referring to Tables and Figures in the Text
In the text, refer to every table and figure by its number—known as a callout (see Sections 7.10 and 7.24, respectively, for how
to assign numbers for tables and figures that accompany the main text; see Section 2.14 for how to assign numbers for tables and
figures that appear in appendices). When you call out a table or figure, also tell readers what to look for in that table or figure.

As shown in Table 1, the demographic characteristics . . .
Figure 2 shows the event-related potentials . . .
. . . of the results of the testing (see Table 3).
. . . of the comparisons (see Figures 4 and 7).

196

Do not write “the table above” (or “below”) or “the figure on page 32.” Page numbers often shift during the writing process,
which  can  lead  to  errors.  For  published  work,  final  page  numbers  and  the  placement  of  tables  and  figures  on  the  page  are
determined during typesetting. Referring to tables and figures by number rather than by location on the page also helps readers
who access a work using assistive technologies such as screen readers. Authors seeking publication also should not write “place
Table 1 here” or “put Figure 2 here”; the typesetter will determine the position of tables and figures in relation to the callouts.

7.6 Placement of Tables and Figures
There are two options for the placement of tables and figures in a paper. The first option is to place all tables and figures on
separate  pages  after  the  reference  list  (with  each  table  on  a  separate  page  followed  by  each  figure  on  a  separate  page).  The
second  option  is  to  embed  each  table  and  figure  within  the  text  after  its  first  callout.  Follow  the  specifications  of  the  journal
publisher or of the classroom assignment for the placement of tables and figures. Placing all tables and figures on separate pages
after  the  reference  list  may  be  preferable  for  manuscripts  being  submitted  for  publication  to  facilitate  copyediting;  either
approach  is  appropriate  for  student  assignments  or  when  the  placement  for  tables  and  figures  has  not  been  specified.
Dissertations  and  theses  may  have  different  specifications  for  the  placement  of  tables  and  figures;  for  example,  in  some
university guidelines, multiple tables or figures may be placed on the same page at the end of the document as long as they fit.
When formatting your dissertation or thesis, abide by the guidelines specified by your advisor and/or university. Authors seeking
publication may need to submit figures as high-resolution files separate from the manuscript regardless of where the figures are
located within the manuscript.

Align  all  tables  and  figures  with  the  left  margin  regardless  of  where  they  appear  in  the  paper.  When  embedding  a  table  or
figure within the text, position it after a full paragraph, ideally the paragraph where it is first called out. Place the table or figure
so that it fits on one page if possible (see Section 7.18 for tables longer or wider than a page). If text appears on the same page as
a table or figure, add a double-spaced blank line between the text and the table or figure so that the separation between the text
and table or figure is easier to see. Put a short table or small figure at the beginning or end of a page rather than in the middle.

Tables and figures that support but are not essential to the text may be placed in one or more appendices. Tables and figures
may appear within an appendix that also contains text, or a table or figure may constitute a whole appendix by itself (see Section
2.14). Tables and figures can also be placed in supplemental materials when they would enrich understanding of the material
presented in the article but are not essential to a basic understanding or cannot be fully displayed in print (see Section 2.15). If
tables or figures are included as supplemental materials, call them out in the text but describe them only briefly (e.g., write “see
Table 1 in the supplemental materials for the list of stimuli”).

7.7 Reprinting or Adapting Tables and Figures
If you reprint or adapt a table or figure from another source in your paper (e.g., a table from your own published work, an image
you found on the internet), you must include a copyright attribution in the table note or figure note indicating the origin of the
reprinted or adapted material in addition to a reference list entry for the work. You may also need to obtain permission from the
copyright holder to reprint or adapt the table or figure. Table 7.14 in Section 7.21 and Figures 7.3, 7.14, and 7.21 in Section 7.36
show  copyright  attributions  for  an  adapted  table  when  permission  is  not  necessary,  a  reprinted  figure  when  permission  is  not
necessary, a reprinted figure in the public domain, and a figure reprinted with permission, respectively. See Sections 12.14  to
12.18 for further information on copyright and permission and for more copyright attribution formats and examples.

Tables

7.8 Principles of Table Construction

Tables should be integral to the text but designed so that they are concise and can be understood in isolation. The principle of
conciseness  is  relevant  not  only  for  tables  included  with  the  main  text  but  also  for  tables  to  be  placed  in  appendices  and
supplemental  materials.  Although  supplemental  tables  may  be  longer  and  more  detailed  than  tables  that  accompany  the  main
text, they must be directly and clearly related to the content of the article (see Section 2.15).

All  tables  are  meant  to  show  something  specific;  for  example,  tables  that  communicate  quantitative  data  are  effective  only
when the data are arranged so that their meaning is obvious at a glance (Wainer, 1997). Often, the same data can be arranged in
different ways to emphasize different features of the data, and which arrangement is better depends on your purpose. Above all,
table layout should be logical and easily grasped by readers. Table entries that are to be compared should be next to one another.
In  general,  different  indices  (e.g.,  means,  sample  sizes)  should  be  presented  in  different  rows  or  columns.  Place  variable  and

197

condition  labels  close  to  their  values  to  facilitate  comparison.  See  the  sample  tables  (Section 7.21)  for  examples  of  effective
layouts.

7.9 Table Components
The basic components of a prototypical table are shown in Table 7.1 and are summarized as follows.

number: The table number (e.g., Table 1) appears above the table in bold font (see Section 7.10).

title: The table title appears one double-spaced line below the table number in italic title case (see Sections 6.17 and 7.11).

headings: Tables may include a variety of headings depending on the nature and arrangement of the data. All tables should
include  column  headings,  including  a  stub  heading  (heading  for  the  leftmost  column).  Some  tables  also  include  column
spanners, decked heads, and table spanners (see Section 7.12).

body: The  table  body  includes  all  the  rows  and  columns  of  a  table  (see  Section 7.13).  A  cell  is  the  point  of  intersection
between a row and a column. The body may be single-spaced, one-and-a-half-spaced, or double-spaced.

notes: Three types of notes (general, specific, and probability) appear below the table as needed to describe contents of the
table  that  cannot  be  understood  from  the  table  title  or  body  alone  (e.g.,  definitions  of  abbreviations,  copyright  attribution).
Not all tables include table notes (see Section 7.14).

Full Description.

See Section 7.21 for sample tables.

7.10 Table Numbers

199

Number all tables that are part of the main text (i.e., not part of an appendix or supplemental materials) using Arabic numerals—
for example, Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3. Assign the numbers in the order in which each table is first mentioned in the text,
regardless  of  whether  a  more  detailed  discussion  of  the  table  occurs  elsewhere  in  the  paper.  Write  the  word  “Table”  and  the
number  in  bold  and  flush  left  (i.e.,  not  indented  or  centered).  Tables  that  appear  in  appendices  follow  a  different  numbering
scheme (see Section 2.14).

7.11 Table Titles
Give  every  table  a  brief  but  clear  and  explanatory  title;  the  basic  content  of  the  table  should  be  easily  inferred  from  the  title.
Write the table title in italic title case below the table number and double-space the table number and title. Avoid overly general
and overly detailed table titles.

The title is specific but not redundant
with headings.

Abbreviations that appear in the headings or the body of a table may be parenthetically explained in the table title.

Hit and False-Alarm (FA) Proportions in Experiment 2

Abbreviations  may  also  be  defined  in  a  general  note  to  the  table  (see  Section 7.14).  Do  not  use  a  specific  note  to  clarify  an
element of the title.

7.12 Table Headings
Headings establish the organization of information in the table and identify what is in each column. Column headings describe
the entries below them. Table headings should be brief; if possible, the heading should be not much wider than the information
in the column below it. Provide a heading for every column in a table, including the stub column or stub, which is the leftmost
column of the table (see Table 7.1 for an illustration).

The stub column usually lists the major independent or predictor variables. In Table 7.1, for instance, the stub column lists the
grades. For the stub column, the heading “Variable” is often used when no other heading is suitable. Write the entries in the stub
column in parallel form (see Section 4.24 for guidance on parallel construction). Number entries in the stub column only in a
correlation  matrix  (see  Tables  7.10–7.11  in  Section  7.21)  or  when  they  are  referred  to  by  number  in  the  text.  To  show
subordination within the stub column, use indentation rather than creating an additional column (see, e.g., Table 7.2, in which
“Single,”  “Married/Partnered,”  etc.  are  indented  under  the  heading  “Marital  Status”).1  Set  indentation  using  the  paragraph-
formatting feature of your word-processing program rather than by using the tab key. In typeset articles, the indentation is equal
to one em space; this can be approximated in draft manuscripts by setting the paragraph indentation to 0.15 in. or inserting an em
space from the special characters menu of your word-processing program.

The headings above the columns to the right of the stub column identify what is in each column. A column heading applies to
just one column; a column spanner is a heading that covers two or more columns, each with its own column heading. Headings
stacked in this way are called decked heads. Often, decked heads can be used to avoid repetition of words in column headings
(see Table 7.1). If possible, do not use more than two levels of decked heads. More complex tables may require table spanners,
which are headings within the body of the table that cover the entire width of the table, allowing for further divisions within the
table  when  the  column  headings  remain  the  same  (see  Table  7.1).  Table  spanners  can  also  be  used  to  combine  two  tables,
provided they have identical column headings.

Any item within a column should be syntactically as well as conceptually comparable with the other items in that column, and
all  items  should  be  described  by  the  column  heading.  For  example,  a  column  with  the  heading  “%”  would  contain  only
percentages; numbers in that column would not be followed by the percent symbol because the symbol is already in the heading
(see Table 7.2 in Section 7.21).

200

Use  sentence  case  for  all  headings  in  a  table  (see  Section  6.17).  Center  all  table  headings  above  their  column(s).  Stub
headings,  column  headings,  and  column  spanners  should  be  singular  (e.g.,  Measure,  Item)  unless  they  refer  to  a  group  (e.g.,
Children, Women), but table spanners may be singular or plural.

7.13 Table Body
The main part of the table, the table body, contains information organized in cells. Information in a table body may be in the
form of numbers, words, or a mixture of both. The body of the table (including table headings) may be single-spaced, one-and-a-
half-spaced,  or  double-spaced,  depending  on  which  presentation  most  effectively  conveys  information  to  readers  (e.g.,  single
spacing may allow a table to fit on one page). If entries are longer than one line, use a hanging indent of 0.15 in. or one em
space. In the stub column of the table, center the stub heading and align the entries flush left beneath it. If entries in this column
are  significantly  shorter  than  the  stub  heading,  it  is  permissible  to  center  them  beneath  the  stub  heading  (e.g.,  single-digit
numbers in the stub column; see the partial table later in this section for an example). The entries in all other cells of the table
should be centered (however, aligning them flush left is acceptable if doing so improves the readability of longer entries). Use
sentence case for all word entries in the table body (see Section 6.17). Numbers that appear in the table body should be written
as  words  or  numerals  according  to  the  guidelines  in  Sections 6.32  to  6.39;  however,  it  is  permissible  to  use  numerals  for  all
numbers in tables if this would be clearer or save space.

Decimal  Values.  Express  numerical  values  to  the  number  of  decimal  places  that  the  precision  of  measurement  justifies  (see
Section  6.36).  If  possible,  carry  all  comparable  values  to  the  same  number  of  decimal  places.  Numerical  values  should  be
centered in the column and may also be aligned on the decimal if desired (for the published version, the typesetter will typically
center values and align on the decimal).

Empty Cells. If a cell cannot be filled because data are not applicable, leave the cell blank. Use a general or specific table note if
you need to explain why the cell is blank or the element is inapplicable (see Section 7.14). If a cell cannot be filled because data
were not obtained or are not reported, insert a dash in that cell and explain the use of the dash in the general note to the table (see
Section 7.14). By convention, a dash in the main diagonal position of a correlation matrix (see Tables 7.10–7.11 in Section 7.21)
indicates  the  correlation  of  an  item  with  itself,  which  must  be  1.00,  and  is  simply  replaced  by  the  dash  with  no  explanation
needed.

Conciseness. Be selective in your presentation. Do not include columns of data that can be calculated easily from other columns.
For  example,  the  following  partial  table  is  redundant  because  it  shows  both  the  number  of  responses  per  trial  and  the  total
number of responses; instead, show only whichever is more important to the discussion.

Citations in Tables. If a table contains citations to other works, follow the formats described in Section 8.11. Use an ampersand
(&)  for  the  word  “and”  in  all  citations  in  tables  to  conserve  space.  Table  7.4  in  Section  7.21  shows  an  example  of  a  table
containing citations to studies included in a meta-analysis.

7.14 Table Notes
Tables may have three kinds of notes, which are placed below the body of the table: general notes, specific notes, and probability
notes. Table notes apply only to a specific table and not to any other table. If information in one table note is true for another
table, repeat the information in the notes for both tables so that the tables can be understood on their own. Some tables do not
require table notes at all.

General  Note.  A general  note  qualifies,  explains,  or  provides  information  relating  to  the  table  as  a  whole  and  explains  any
abbreviations;  symbols;  special  use  of  italics,  bold,  or  parentheses;  and  the  like.  The  general  note  also  includes  any
acknowledgments that a table is reprinted or adapted from another source (see Section 7.7). General notes are designated by the

201

word “Note” (italicized) followed by a period (see Table 7.1 and the sample tables in Section 7.21 for examples). Explanations
of abbreviations and copyright attributions for reprinted or adapted tables appear at the end of the general note, in that order.

Note. Factor loadings greater than .45 are shown in bold. M = match process; N = nonmatch process.

Specific Note. A specific note refers to a particular column, row, or cell. Specific notes are indicated by superscript lowercase
letters  (e.g.,  a, b, c).  Do  not  add  specific  notes  to  a  table  title;  instead,  use  a  general  note.  Within  each  table  that  has  specific
notes, order the superscripts from left to right and from top to bottom, starting at the top left and beginning with the letter “a”
(see,  e.g.,  Tables 7.2, 7.10,  and  7.15  in  Section 7.21).  The  corresponding  specific  note  below  the  table  begins  with  the  same
superscript  letter.  Place  a  superscript  space  before  the  superscript  letter  in  the  table  body  (e.g.,  Group  a).  Place  a  superscript
space after the superscript letter in the specific note. This space prevents specific notes from getting caught by spell-check and
improves readability.

a n = 25. b This participant did not complete the trials.

Probability Note. A probability note describes how asterisks and other symbols are used in a table to indicate p values and thus
the significance of the results of statistical hypothesis testing. To report the results of significance testing, it is best to provide the
exact probabilities to two or three decimal places (e.g., p = .023; see, e.g., Tables 7.8–7.9 in Section 7.21; see also Section 3.7
and Section 6.36). However, when p values are less than .001, it is acceptable to write the value as “<.001.”

It may sometimes be difficult to report exact p values in a table because doing so would make the table difficult to read. An
alternative to reporting exact p values in a table is to use the “p <” notation. Use this notation only in tables and figures (see
Section 7.28 for more on figure notes), not in the text. In the “p <” notation, asterisks or daggers appear after table entries to
indicate that the entries have reached the established threshold for significance; definitions of the asterisks and/or daggers appear
in a corresponding probability note. Use the same number of asterisks to indicate the same p values across tables (or figures)
within your paper, such as *p < .05, **p < .01, and ***p < .001 (see, e.g., Tables 7.10–7.11 in Section 7.21). In general, do not
use  any  p  value  smaller  than  .001.  Daggers  are  sometimes  used  to  indicate  nonsignificant  trends  based  on  the  threshold
established for your study (e.g., †p < .10) or to distinguish between one-tailed and two-tailed tests. Use superscript formatting
for asterisks and daggers. In a table body (or a figure), position asterisks and daggers immediately after the entries they belong
to, with no space in between (e.g., .02*). In the probability note, place asterisks and daggers immediately before the p, with no
space in between (e.g., *p < .002).

One-Tailed Versus Two-Tailed Tests. If you need to distinguish between one-tailed and two-tailed tests in the same table, use
an  asterisk  for  the  two-tailed  p  values  and  an  alternate  symbol  (e.g.,  dagger)  for  the  one-tailed  p  values,  and  specify  the
convention in the probability note.

*p < .05, two-tailed. **p < .01, two-tailed. †p < .05, one-tailed. ††p < .01, one-tailed.

Indicating Significant Differences Between Values. To indicate statistically significant differences between two or more table
values—for  example,  when  comparing  values  with  post  hoc  tests  such  as  Tukey’s  honestly  significant  difference  (HSD)  test,
Bonferroni procedure, Scheffé method, Fisher’s least significant difference, or Duncan’s new multiple range test—use lowercase
subscript letters (see Table 7.9 in Section 7.21 for an example). Explain the use of the subscripts in the table’s general note, as in
the following example:

Note. Means sharing a common subscript are not significantly different at α = .01 according to Tukey’s honestly significant difference
procedure.

Formatting of Notes. Begin each kind of note on a new line below the table body. A general note appears first. A specific note
begins on a new line under a general note; subsequent specific notes begin on the same line. A probability note begins on a new
line under any general or specific notes; subsequent probability notes begin on the same line. Multiple specific or probability
notes are separated from each other by a period and a space. Lengthy specific notes may be presented on separate lines if this
improves readability. Double-space all table notes, and align all notes flush left (i.e., with no paragraph indentation).

Note. The responses were gathered in the laboratory.
a n = 25. b n = 42.
*p < .05. **p < .01. ***p < .001.

Use of Notes to Eliminate Repetition. Table  notes  can  be  useful  for  eliminating  repetition  from  the  body  of  a  table.  Certain
types of information are appropriate either in the table body or in a note. To determine the placement of such material, remember
that clearly and efficiently organized data enable readers to focus on those data. Thus, if probability values or subsample sizes
are numerous, use a column rather than many notes. Conversely, if a row or column contains few entries (or the same entry),
eliminate the column by adding a note to the table, as shown in the following partial tables.

7.15 Standard Abbreviations in Tables and Figures
Use standard abbreviations and symbols for all statistics (e.g., M, SD, SE, F, df, n, p), Greek letters (e.g., α, β, χ2), and units of
measurement (see Tables 6.4–6.5) used in tables without defining them in a note. This guidance also applies to statistics, Greek
letters, and units of measurement appearing in figures (see Section 7.28 for more on figure notes). The abbreviation “no.” (for
“number”) and the symbol “%” (for “percent”) may also be used without providing a definition. Other abbreviations used in a
table or figure should be defined in the table or figure title, body, or note, even if the abbreviations are also defined in the paper
(see Sections 6.25 and 6.44). Except where it makes sense to group similar abbreviations, define the abbreviations in the order
that they appear in the table, starting at the top left and moving left to right, top to bottom.

7.16 Confidence Intervals in Tables
When a table includes point estimates—for example, means, correlations, or regression slopes—it should also, when possible,
include confidence intervals. Report confidence intervals in tables either by using square brackets, as in the text (see Section 6.9)
and in Table 7.16 in Section 7.21, or by giving lower and upper limits in separate columns, as in Table 7.17 in Section 7.21. In
every table that includes confidence intervals, state the confidence level (e.g., 95% or 99%). It is usually best to use the same
confidence level throughout a paper.

7.17 Table Borders and Shading
Limit the use of borders or lines in a table to those needed for clarity. In general, use a border at the top and bottom of the table,
beneath column headings (including decked heads), and above column spanners. You may also use a border to separate a row
containing totals or other summary information from other rows in the table (see Table 7.1 for an example). Do not use vertical
borders to separate data, and do not use borders around every cell in a table. Use spacing between columns and rows and strict
alignment to clarify relations among the elements in a table.

Avoid the use of shading in tables. Do not use shading for mere decoration. To emphasize the content of a particular cell or
cells, use a specific or probability note; italics or bold may also be used with explanation in the table’s general note. Instead of
using shading, add white space or borders between rows and columns to help readers distinguish them. If shading is necessary,
explain its purpose in the table’s general note.

7.18 Long or Wide Tables
If a table is longer than one page, repeat the heading row on each subsequent page of the table. It is best to use the automated
table-formatting tools of your word-processing program rather than manually retyping the headings. Table 7.4  in  Section 7.21
shows an example of a multipage table—in this case, a table summarizing the studies included in a meta-analysis.

Wide tables may be presented in landscape orientation (it is not important if landscape orientation impacts the position of the
page header). If a table in landscape format is still too wide to fit on one page, the stub column (left column) should repeat on
each subsequent page. If a table is too wide and too long to fit on one page, create separate tables.

7.19 Relation Between Tables

203

Consider  combining  tables  that  repeat  data.  Ordinarily,  identical  columns  or  rows  of  data  should  not  appear  in  two  or  more
tables.  Be  consistent  in  the  presentation  of  all  tables  within  a  paper  to  facilitate  comparisons.  Use  similar  formats,  titles,  and
headings and the same terminology across tables whenever possible (e.g., do not use “response time” in one table and “reaction
time” in another table to refer to the same concept). If multiple tables contain similar data but cannot be combined, number these
tables separately (e.g., Table 1 and Table 2); do not use letters to indicate subtables (i.e., do not label two tables Table 1A and
Table 1B).

7.20 Table Checklist
The  table  checklist  may  help  ensure  that  the  data  in  your  table  are  effectively  presented  and  conform  to  the  style  guidelines
presented in this chapter.

7.21 Sample Tables
Some tables have certain standard, or canonical, forms (e.g., a correlation table). When possible, use a standard form rather than
designing your own form. The advantage of using the canonical form is that readers generally already know where to look in the
table for certain kinds of information. In some situations, you may want to use a form other than the canonical table form to
make a specific point or to stress certain relationships. The judicious use of nonstandard forms can be effective but must always
be motivated by the special circumstances of the data array. When using nonstandard forms, make certain that labeling is clear.

Sample tables are presented next; follow these samples to design basic tables. The exact contents and structure of your table
will vary from the sample tables depending on the nature of the information being presented. For variations not addressed in this
chapter, consult similar published articles to see examples of current standards and practices.

Does the table belong in the print and electronic versions of the article, or can it be placed in supplemental materials?

Are all comparable tables in the paper consistent in presentation?

Are  all  tables  numbered  consecutively  with  Arabic  numerals  in  the  order  in  which  they  are  first  mentioned  in  the  text?  Is  the  table
number bold and flush left?

Are all tables called out or referred to in the text?

Is the table title brief but explanatory? Is it written in italic title case and flush left?

Does every column have a column heading, including the leftmost (stub) column? Are all column headings centered?

Are  all  abbreviations  explained  (with  exceptions  as  noted  in  Section 7.15),  as  well  as  the  special  use  of  italics,  bold,  parentheses,
dashes, and symbols?

Are the table notes, if needed, in the order of general note, specific note, and probability note? Are the notes double-spaced and flush
left and in the same font as the text of the paper?

Are table borders correctly applied (at the top and bottom of the table, beneath column headings, above table spanners)?

Is the line spacing of the table correctly applied (double-spacing for the table number, title, and notes; single-spacing, one-and-a-half-
spacing, or double-spacing for the table body)?

Are entries in the left column flush left beneath the centered stub heading? Are all other column headings and cell entries centered
(except when aligning entries to the left would improve readability)?

Are confidence intervals reported for all major point estimates? Is the confidence level—for example, 95%—stated, and is the same
level of confidence used for all tables and throughout the paper?

If  the  results  of  statistical  significance  testing  are  included  in  the  table,  are  all  p  values  correctly  identified?  Are  exact  p  values
provided? Is the “p <” notation used only when needed? When the “p <” notation is used, are asterisks or daggers attached to the
appropriate  table  entries  and  defined?  Are  asterisks  or  daggers  used  consistently  to  indicate  the  same  p value  in  all  tables  in  the
same paper?

If all or part of a table is reprinted or adapted, is there a copyright attribution? If permission was necessary to reproduce the table,
have  you  received  written  permission  for  its  reuse  (in  print  and  electronic  forms)  from  the  copyright  holder  and  sent  a  copy  of  that
written permission with the final version of your paper?

demographic  characteristics  of  study  participants  (Table  7.2):  Demographic  data  can  help  readers  understand  the
generalizability of the results. The demographic data you report will depend on the nature of the study.

properties of study variables (Table 7.3):  Describe  the  properties  of  study  variables  (e.g.,  means,  standard  deviations).  If
reporting psychometric information, clearly state the index of reliability (or other psychometric property) being used and the
sample on which the reliability was based (if different from the study sample).

meta-analysis summary (Table 7.4): The qualities of the studies included in a meta-analysis can be reported in a table as a
summary for readers (what information is relevant to report will depend on the nature of the study).

summary of complex experimental design (Table 7.5): Complex designs can be summarized in a table, making the entire
structure of the experiment(s) clear without the need for lengthy textual description.

descriptive  statistics  for  study  measures  (Table  7.6):  Descriptive  statistics  include  means  and  standard  deviations.  The
exact statistics you should provide will depend on the nature and purpose of the analyses.

chi-square  results  (Table 7.7):  The  results  of  individual  chi-square  tests  are  usually  reported  in  the  text  only  (see  Section
6.43).  The  results  of  multiple  chi-square  tests  may  be  summarized  in  a  table,  which  typically  also  includes  frequencies,  p
values, and any other relevant statistics such as effect sizes.

t-test results (Table 7.8): When there is only one t test to report, the results should be incorporated into the text (see Section
6.43). Use a table to report the results of multiple t tests.

a priori or post hoc comparisons (Table 7.9):  A  priori  and  post  hoc  tests  (e.g.,  Tukey’s  HSD  test,  Bonferroni  procedure,
Scheffé method, Fisher’s least significant difference, Duncan’s new multiple range test) are used to compare specific group
means in studies in which the independent variables have more than two levels. Although these results are often presented in
the text rather than in a table, a table can be used to summarize comparisons. This table is similar to the table for presenting
descriptive statistics (Table 7.6) with the addition of subscripts to note significantly different means.

correlations (Tables 7.10–7.11): A correlation table presents correlations between study variables and may also incorporate
descriptive  statistics,  alpha  values,  or  other  relevant  statistics  (Table  7.10).  The  perfect  correlation  along  the  diagonal  is
indicated by an em dash. Intercorrelations for two different groups can be presented in the same table, with correlations for
one group above the diagonal and for the other group below the diagonal (Table 7.11). The variables in a correlation table
should  be  numbered  and  named  in  the  stub  column,  with  corresponding  numbers  alone  in  the  column  headings  to  avoid
repeating the variable names in the column headings.

analysis of variance (Tables 7.12–7.13): The results of a single one-way ANOVA are typically reported in the text only. The
results of multiple ANOVAs can be reported in a table; various presentations are possible. For example, degrees of freedom
may be presented in the column heading when they are the same for all tests (Table 7.12) or in their own column when they
differ (Table 7.13). Sums of squares and mean squares are not typically included in tables intended for publication.

factor analysis (Table 7.14): Factor coefficients or loadings (rotated or unrotated) can be presented in a variety of ways and
may be accompanied by other indices such as the percentage of variance and eigenvalues. If a rotation is used, specify the
type (e.g., varimax, oblimin). Factor coefficients or loadings above a prescribed threshold are typically indicated by the use of
bold; the purpose of any bolding should be explained in the table note.

multiple regression (Tables 7.15–7.18): The results of multiple regression, including mediation and moderation analyses, can
be presented in a variety of ways depending on the purpose of the table and need for detail. Clearly label the regression type
(e.g.,  hierarchical)  and  the  type  of  regression  coefficients  (raw  or  standardized)  being  reported.  For  hierarchical  and  other
sequential regressions, be sure to provide the increments of change (see Section 6.43). Four options are shown in the sample
tables:  regression  coefficients  without  confidence  intervals  (Table  7.15),  regression  coefficients  and  bracketed  confidence
intervals  (Table  7.16),  moderator  analysis  with  confidence  intervals  in  separate  columns  (Table  7.17),  and  hierarchical
multiple regression (Table 7.18).

model comparisons (Tables 7.19–7.21): Model comparison tables are used to compare different models of data (Table 7.19),
including multilevel models (Table 7.20), and to report the results of confirmatory factor analyses (Table 7.21). Ensure that
the  competing  models  are  clearly  identified  and  that  the  comparisons  are  clearly  specified.  Comparative  fit  indices  can  be
useful for readers.

qualitative tables (Tables 7.22–7.23): Qualitative data can be presented in tabular form in an innumerable variety of ways
depending on the purpose of the table. Qualitative tables might include descriptions of variables (as in Table 7.22), referenced

205

studies, test items, or quotations from research participants. Quantitative data may be incorporated alongside the qualitative
data (e.g., quotations might be presented alongside response frequencies, as in Table 7.23).

mixed methods tables (Table 7.24): The procedures or findings of mixed methods research can be presented in tabular form
in various ways depending on the purpose of the table.

Master Narrative Voices: Struggle and Success and Emancipation

Discourse and dimension

Example quote

Struggle and success

Self-actualization as a member of a larger

“My path of gayness . . . going from denial to saying, ‘well, this is it,’ and then the

gay community is the end goal of
healthy sexual identity development, or
“coming out”

process of coming out, and the process of just sort of looking around and seeing,
well where do I stand in the world? And sort of having, uh, political feelings.” (Carl,
age 50)

Maintaining healthy sexual identity entails

vigilance against internalization of
societal discrimination

“When I’m, like, thinking of criticisms of more mainstream gay culture, I try to . . . make
sure it’s coming from an appropriate place and not, like, a place of self-loathing.”
(Patrick, age 20)

Emancipation

Open exploration of an individually fluid

sexual self is the goal of healthy sexual
identity development

“[For heterosexuals] the man penetrates the woman, whereas with gay people, I feel
like there is this potential for really playing around with that model a lot, you know,
and just experimenting and exploring.” (Orion, age 31)

Questioning discrete, monolithic
categories of sexual identity

“LGBTQI, you know, and added on so many letters. It does start to raise the question

about what the terms mean and whether . . . any term can adequately be
descriptive.” (Bill, age 50)

that if I sort of know it already, then the source is not so critical .
. . whereas with nuclear energy, I don’t know so much, so then
I’m maybe more interested in who says what.”

Participant 3: “[Nuclear power], which I know much, much less
about, I would back up my arguments more with what I trust
from the professors.”

Note. We integrated quantitative data (whether students selected a card about nuclear power or about climate change) and qualitative data

(interviews with students) to provide a more comprehensive description of students’ card selections between the two topics.

Figures

7.22 Principles of Figure Construction

All types of graphical displays other than tables are considered figures in APA Style. Ensure that all figures add substantively to
readers’  understanding  and  do  not  duplicate  other  elements  of  the  paper.  Also  consider  whether  a  figure  is  the  best  way  to
communicate the information. In some cases (particularly when quantitative information is being conveyed), a table may offer
more  precision  than,  say,  a  graph.  If  you  focus  on  the  principle  of  enhancing  readers’  understanding,  other  questions—for
example, use of color, use of photographic images, or magnitude of cropping of a picture—should be relatively easy to resolve.

The standards for good figures are simplicity, clarity, continuity, and (of course) information value. A good figure

augments rather than duplicates the text,
conveys only essential information,
omits visually distracting detail,
is easy to read—its elements (e.g., type, lines, labels, symbols) are large enough to be seen and interpreted with ease,
is easy to understand—its purpose is readily apparent,
is carefully planned and prepared, and
is consistent with and in the same style as similar figures in the same article.

For figures of all types, check that

images are clear,
lines are smooth and sharp,
font is simple and legible,
units of measurement are provided,
axes are clearly labeled, and
elements within the figure are labeled or explained.

Be  certain,  for  instance,  to  distinguish  between  error  bars  and  confidence  intervals.  When  using  confidence  intervals,  clearly
specify the size of the interval (e.g., 95%); when using error bars, provide the label for the error (e.g., standard error of the mean)
in the figure image or note. In addition, check all figures to ensure that

sufficient information is given in the legend and/or note to make the figure understandable on its own (i.e., apart from the
text),

symbols are easy to differentiate, and

the graphic is large enough for its elements to be discernible.

Even  when  using  high-quality  graphics  software  to  construct  figures,  examine  figures  carefully  and  make  any  necessary
adjustments to follow these guidelines.

7.23 Figure Components
The basic components of a prototypical figure are shown in Figure 7.1 and are summarized as follows:

number: The figure number (e.g., Figure 1) appears above the figure in bold (see Section 7.24).

title: The figure title appears one double-spaced line below the figure number in italic title case (see Sections 6.17 and 7.25).

image: The image portion of the figure is the chart, graph, photograph, drawing, or other illustration itself (see Section 7.26).

legend: A figure legend, or key, if present, should be positioned within the borders of the figure and explains any symbols
used in the figure image (see Section 7.27).

note: Three types of notes (general, specific, and probability) can appear below the figure to describe contents of the figure
that  cannot  be  understood  from  the  figure  title,  image,  and/or  legend  alone  (e.g.,  definitions  of  abbreviations,  copyright
attribution). Not all figures include figure notes (see Section 7.28).

Full Description.

See Section 7.36 for sample figures.

7.24 Figure Numbers
Number all figures that are part of the main text (i.e., not part of an appendix or supplemental materials) using Arabic numerals
—for example, Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3. Assign the numbers in the order in which each figure is first mentioned in the
text, regardless of whether a more detailed discussion of the figure occurs elsewhere in the paper. Write the word “Figure” and
the number in bold and flush left (i.e., not indented or centered). Figures that appear in appendices follow a different numbering
scheme (see Section 2.14).

236

7.25 Figure Titles
Give every figure a brief but clear and explanatory title; the basic content of the figure should be easily inferred from the title.
Write  the  figure  title  in  italic  title  case  below  the  figure  number  and  double-space  the  figure  number  and  title.  Avoid  overly
general and overly detailed figure titles (see Section 7.11).

7.26 Figure Images
The image part of the figure (e.g., graph, chart, diagram) should be saved in a resolution sufficient to allow for clear printing or
viewing (see Section 7.4). Attend to the following considerations when creating images.

Size and Proportion of Elements. Each element in a figure must be large enough and sharp enough to be legible. Use a simple
sans serif font (e.g., Arial, Calibri, Lucida Sans Unicode; see Section 2.19) within the image portion of the figure with enough
space  between  letters  to  avoid  crowding.  Letters  should  be  clear,  sharp,  and  uniformly  dark  and  should  be  sized  consistently
throughout the figure; the font size should be no smaller than 8 points and no larger than 14 points. As a general guideline, plot
symbols should be about the size of lowercase letters that appear in a label within the figure. Also consider the weight (i.e., size,
density) of each element in a figure in relation to that of every other element, and make the most important elements the most
prominent. For example, curves on line graphs and outlines of bars on bar graphs should be bolder than axis labels, which should
be bolder than the axes and tick marks.

Spelling, Capitalization, and Numbers Within Figure Images. Use title case for axis labels. Abbreviate the words “number”
to “no.” and “percentage” to “%.” Words within figure images other than those on the axis labels or in the figure legend may be
written in either title case or sentence case (see Section 6.17), depending on the contents of the figure. In general, labels, phrases,
or  words  that  serve  as  headings  would  be  better  set  in  title  case,  whereas  other  descriptive  phrases,  sentences,  or  paragraphs
within a figure would be better set in sentence case. Numbers that appear in the image portion of a figure should be written as
words  or  numerals  according  to  the  guidelines  in  Sections  6.32  to  6.39;  however,  it  is  permissible  to  use  numerals  for  all
numbers in a figure if this would be clearer or save space. Statistics, Greek letters, and units of measurement do not need to be
defined in a figure note (see Section 7.15).

Shading. Limit the number of different shadings used in a single graphic. If different shadings are used to distinguish bars or
segments of a graph, choose shadings that are distinct; for example, the best option to distinguish two sets of bars is no shading
(“open”) and black or gray (“solid”). If more than two shadings are needed, use patterns, again making sure that the patterns are
distinct—for  example,  use  no  (open)  shading,  solid  black  or  gray,  and  stripes  for  three  shadings.  If  error  bars  or  other
information overlaps with shaded areas (e.g., double-sided error bars in a bar graph), ensure that the overlapping information can
be clearly distinguished from the shading.

Color. Color can serve both communicative and decorative purposes in figures. Authors seeking publication should avoid the
use of color except when it is necessary for understanding the material because of the relatively high cost of color reproduction
for  printed  materials  (authors  may  bear  some  of  this  cost;  for  APA  journals  guidelines,  see  http://on.apa.org/WDtxdW).  For
example,  photographs,  fMRI  images,  and  gene  staining  results  often  use  color.  If  color  representation  is  not  crucial  for
understanding and the article is to be published both in print and online, convert the figure to grayscale or consider placing the
figure online as supplemental material. Some journals offer the option to publish a figure in color online and in grayscale in print
at no cost; when using this option, ensure that the figure can still be understood even when it is printed in grayscale. It is the
author’s responsibility to ensure that the final representation is accurate. However, authors submitting a manuscript to an online-
only journal may use color more liberally (e.g., colored bars rather than gray and white bars in a bar graph). Likewise, students
preparing a figure for a course assignment may use color provided that the assignment will be delivered in a format that supports
it.

When selecting colors for a figure, ensure that there is plenty of contrast so that people living with a color-vision deficiency
(often referred to as “color blindness”) or people who do not see color in a typical way can understand the information and tell
the  colors  apart.  Best  practice
free  Colour  Contrast  Analyser
to  use  a  contrast  checker  such  as
(https://developer.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser)  to  evaluate  the  contrast  ratio  and  confirm  that  your  content
passes the standards for WCAG 2.0 AA or later.2 Adequate contrast ratios ensure that the figure is not only accessible to readers
with color-deficient vision but also understandable by all readers if the figure is printed or photocopied in grayscale. Another
strategy to achieve adequate contrast is to use a pattern in combination with color so that the differentiation of elements does not

the

is

237

rely  on  color  alone  (e.g.,  in  a  line  graph,  different  lines  may  be  in  different  colors  and  also  of  different  styles,  such  as  solid,
dashed, and dotted). When many colors must be used and it is not possible to achieve high contrast among all of them, label
colored  areas  directly  in  the  image  or  use  lines  to  connect  the  object  to  its  label  rather  than  placing  the  label  in  a  legend,  if
possible,  so  that  readers  do  not  have  to  match  colors  in  the  figure  to  colors  in  the  legend.  See  the  APA  Style  website
(https://apastyle.apa.org) for an example of how people with certain color-vision deficiencies see color and how the colors used
in figures can be adjusted to accommodate them.

Gridlines  and  3-D  Effects.  Avoid  the  use  of  gridlines  in  figures  unless  the  gridlines  will  substantially  aid  readers  in
understanding the content, such as when many data points need to be compared across the x-axis. Likewise, avoid including 3-D
effects for mere decoration (e.g., 3-D bar graphs) because they may make the figure more difficult to read. However, 3-D effects
can be used to convey essential information (e.g., 3-D representations of stimuli).

Panels. The decision of whether to divide a figure into panels or create a separate figure for each panel will depend on the nature
of the information being presented. Although panels help readers directly compare information, they also increase the density of
the  information  being  presented  on  the  page;  as  always,  prioritize  clear  communication  when  constructing  any  figure.  If  the
figure includes multiple panels, it is optional to label them. If panels are unlabeled, refer to panels by their position (e.g., the top
panel, the left panel, the middle panel). To label panels, assign each one a capital letter (e.g., A, B) and place the label at the top
left of the panel. Refer to the panels as “Panel A,” “Panel B,” and so forth. In the main text, refer to a panel as “Figure 5A” or
“Panel A of Figure 5.” In the figure general note, explain each panel. See Figures 7.18 and 7.19 in Section 7.36 for examples of
figures with labeled panels.

Citations  in  Figures.  If  a  figure  contains  citations  to  other  works,  follow  the  formats  described  in  Section  8.11.  Use  an
ampersand (&) for the word “and” in all citations in figures to conserve space.

7.27 Figure Legends
A legend (also called a key) explains any symbols, line styles, or shading or pattern variants used in the image portion of the
figure  (see  Figures 7.2–7.3  in  Section 7.36  for  examples).  The  legend  is  an  integral  part  of  the  figure;  therefore,  its  lettering
should be of the same kind and proportion as that appearing in the rest of the figure. Capitalize words in the legend using title
case (see Section 6.17). Only figures that have symbols, line styles, or shadings needing definition should include legends. When
possible, place legends within or below the image instead of to the side to avoid having empty space around the legend.

7.28 Figure Notes
Figure notes contain information needed to clarify the contents of the figure for readers. As with tables, figures may have three
kinds of notes: general, specific, and probability.

A general note should explain units of measurement, symbols, and abbreviations that are not included in the legend or defined
elsewhere in the figure (see Section 7.15 for information on abbreviations and symbols that do not require definitions). Make
certain  that  the  symbols,  abbreviations,  and  terminology  in  the  note  and  legend  match  the  symbols,  abbreviations,  and
terminology in the figure, in other figures in the paper, and in the text. Explain the use of shading, color, and any other design
element  that  carries  meaning.  Provide  individual  descriptions  of  panels  for  multipanel  figures.  If  a  graph  includes  error  bars,
explain in the image or general note whether they represent standard deviations, standard errors, confidence limits, or ranges; it
is also helpful to provide sample sizes. Also include within the general note any acknowledgment that a figure is reprinted or
adapted  from  another  source  (see  Section 7.7).  Place  explanations  of  abbreviations  and  copyright  attributions  for  reproduced
figures last in the general note.

Position any superscripts for specific notes near the element being identified. It is preferable to report exact p values; however,
if  statistically  significant  values  are  marked  with  asterisks  or  daggers  in  the  figure,  explain  them  in  a  probability  note  (see
Section 7.14). For guidelines on formatting figure notes, see Section 7.14.

7.29 Relation Between Figures
Similar  figures  or  figures  of  equal  importance  should  be  of  equal  size  and  scale.  Combine  figures  that  are  alike  to  facilitate
comparisons  between  their  content.  For  example,  two  line  graphs  with  identical  axes  might  be  combined  horizontally  into  a
single figure, or multiple figures might be combined into one figure with multiple panels (see Section 7.26).

238

7.30 Photographs
Photographs  are  a  type  of  figure  with  special  considerations.  Authors  seeking  publication  must  check  publisher  guidelines  to
ensure the photograph is submitted in the correct file type. Photographs may be printed in grayscale or in color, depending on the
contents  of  the  photograph  and  the  venue  of  publication.  Color  photographs  should  include  enough  contrast  to  ensure  that
contents will be understandable if reproduced in grayscale. Photographs in most student papers can be in color and saved in any
widely available photo format (see Section 7.26 for more information on the use of color in figures).

It  is  essential  that  photographic  images  be  submitted  at  appropriate  levels  of  resolution  (as  specified  by  the  publisher).
Because  reproduction  softens  contrast  and  detail  in  photographs,  starting  with  rich  contrast  and  sharp  detail  will  improve  the
final version of the image. The camera view and the lighting should highlight the subject and provide high contrast; a light or
dark  background  can  provide  even  more  contrast.  Photographs  usually  benefit  from  cropping  to,  for  example,  eliminate
extraneous  detail  or  center  the  image.  However,  when  a  photographic  image  has  been  altered  in  a  manner  beyond  simple
cropping and/or adjustment for light levels, clearly indicate in a general note how the image has been altered. Ethical principles
of publication forbid any intentional misrepresentation of images, just as fraudulent data manipulation is forbidden. See Figure
7.17 in Section 7.36 for an example of a photograph as a figure.

If you photograph an identifiable person, obtain a signed release from that person to use the photograph in your paper (see
Section  12.17);  if  the  person  is  not  identifiable,  a  release  is  not  needed.  If  you  took  a  photograph  yourself,  no  citation  or
copyright attribution is required in the figure note. If you want to reprint or adapt a photograph from another source, you may
need to obtain permission to use it in your paper because professional photographs are usually the property of the photographer.
See Sections 12.14 to 12.18 for further information on reprinting or adapting photographs from other sources.

7.31 Considerations for Electrophysiological, Radiological, Genetic, and Other Biological Data
The presentation of electrophysiological, radiological, genetic, and other biological data presents special challenges because of
the complexity of the data. Focus first on making sure your image accurately represents the data. It is essential that you identify
in the general note how images were processed or enhanced and that you clearly label the images. Next, consider principles of
clarity of representation, necessity for inclusion, and consistency among representations. If your figure contains more than one
panel  or  your  paper  contains  more  than  one  figure,  keep  style  and  formatting  elements  as  consistent  as  possible  throughout
(although specific features such as axis labels and scale units may vary). Biological and genetic data often must be presented in
color for the information to be interpretable (see Section 7.26).

Carefully  consider  whether  to  include  complex  graphs  and  images  in  the  main  text  or  as  supplemental  materials.  Use
supplemental  materials  to  present  content  that  is  better  displayed  online  than  in  print  or  that  can  only  be  viewed  online.  For
example, the dynamic spread of brain activation may be able to be displayed only through color video clips.

7.32 Electrophysiological Data
When  presenting  electrophysiological  data,  clear  labeling  of  the  image  is  essential;  for  example,  in  the  presentation  of  event-
related brain potential data, it is essential that the direction of negativity (i.e., negative up or down) be indicated as well as the
scale  of  the  response.  Information  that  is  necessary  for  proper  interpretation  of  the  image,  such  as  number  or  placement  of
electrodes, should accompany the figure. See Figure 7.19  in  Section 7.36  for  an  example  of  a  figure  presenting  event-related
brain potential data.

7.33 Radiological (Imaging) Data
When  presenting  brain  images,  clearly  label  each  image  and  provide  details  needed  to  interpret  the  image  in  the  figure  note.
When  axial  or  coronal  sections  are  being  displayed,  clearly  label  which  hemisphere  is  the  left  and  which  is  the  right.  When
sagittal slices are displayed, clearly indicate whether each slice is of the right or the left hemisphere. When slices are shown, also
present an image that indicates where in the brain the slices were taken to help orient readers. Specify the coordinate space in
which the images have been normalized (e.g., Talairach, MNI).

Cutaway views of the brain that show activations interior to it can be useful if the cutaways clearly depict the tissue that has
been excised. When activations are superimposed on a surface-rendered image of a brain, clear explanation of what activations
are being shown should accompany the figure, particularly with regard to the depth of the activation that has been brought to the
surface;  the  use  of  flattened  surface  images  may  help  make  the  data  clearer.  When  using  color,  use  it  consistently  in  all
representations  within  the  paper  and  clearly  specify  the  color–scale  mapping.  Neuroimaging  data  almost  always  require
extensive postacquisition processing, and details of the processing methods should accompany their display. Photomicrographs

239

are often used in cell-staining and other types of imaging studies. When preparing photomicrographs, include a scale bar and
staining materials information. See Figure 7.20 in Section 7.36 for an example of fMRI data in a figure.

7.34 Genetic Data
As with other displays of biological material, clear labeling of images enhances displays of genetic information (e.g., deletion
patterns),  be  they  of  the  physical  map  variety  or  the  photographic  stain  variety.  Present  information  concerning  locations,
distances,  markers,  and  identification  methods  with  the  figure.  Genetic  data  displays  often  contain  much  information;  careful
and circumscribed editing of the image and its legend can improve the communicative value of the figure. See Figure 7.21 in
Section 7.36 for an example of a physical map of genetic material in a figure.

7.35 Figure Checklist
The figure checklist may be helpful to ensure that your figure communicates effectively and conforms to the style guidelines
presented in this chapter.

Figure Checklist

Is the figure necessary?

Does the figure belong in the print and electronic versions of the article, or can it be placed in supplemental materials?

Is the figure being submitted in a file format acceptable to the publisher?

Has the file been produced at a sufficiently high resolution to allow for accurate reproduction?

Are figures of equally important concepts prepared according to the same size and scale?

Are all figures numbered consecutively with Arabic numerals in the order in which they are first mentioned in the text? Is the figure
number bold and flush left?

Are all figures called out or referred to in the text?

Is the figure title brief but explanatory? Is it written in italic title case and flush left?

Is the figure image simple, clear, and free of extraneous detail?

Are all elements of the image clearly labeled?

Are the magnitude, scale, and direction of grid elements clearly labeled?

Has the figure been formatted properly? Is the font sans serif within the image portion of the figure and between 8 and 14 points in
size?

Are all abbreviations explained (with exceptions as noted in Section 7.15), as well as the use of special symbols?

If the figure includes a legend to define symbols, line styles, or shading variants, does the legend appear within or below the image?
Are words in the legend written in title case?

Have all substantive modifications to photographic images been disclosed?

Are  the  figure  notes,  if  needed,  in  the  order  of  general  note,  specific  note,  and  probability  note?  Are  the  notes  double-spaced  and
flush left and in the same font as the text of the paper?

If all or part of a figure is reprinted or adapted, is there a copyright attribution? If permission was necessary to reproduce the figure,
have you received written permission for reuse (in print and electronic forms) from the copyright holder and sent a copy of that written
permission with the final version of your paper?

7.36 Sample Figures
Many types of figures can be used to present data to readers. The more common types of figures used in qualitative, quantitative,
and  mixed  methods  research  are  presented  next.  There  are  many  variations  and  versions  of  each,  and  the  distinctions  among
many  of  them  are  not  clear.  For  situations  not  addressed  here,  consult  similar  published  articles  to  see  examples  of  current
standards and practices and follow those examples.

graphs (Figures 7.2–7.3): Graphs typically display the relationship between two quantitative indices or between a continuous
quantitative variable (usually displayed on the y-axis) and groups of participants or subjects (usually displayed on the x-axis).
Bar graphs (Figure 7.2) and line graphs (Figure 7.3) are two examples of graphs.

240

charts (Figures 7.4–7.11): Charts generally display nonquantitative information with the use of enclosed boxes, squares, or
circles connected with straight or curved lines or arrows. They are used to

show  the  flow  of  participants  or  subjects,  such  as  through  a  study  process  (Figure 7.4)  or  in  a  randomized  clinical  trial
(Figure 7.5; this is referred to as a CONSORT flow diagram; for a downloadable template, see the CONSORT website at
http://www.consort-statement.org/consort-statement/flow-diagram);
illustrate  models—for  example,  conceptual  or  theoretical  models  (Figure  7.6),  structural  equation  models  (Figure  7.7),
confirmatory factor analysis models (Figure 7.8), and path models (Figure 7.9); and
illustrate qualitative (Figure 7.10) and mixed methods (Figure 7.11) research designs or frameworks.

drawings (Figures 7.12–7.13): Drawings show information pictorially and can be used to illustrate, for example,

experimental setups (Figure 7.12) and
experimental stimuli (Figure 7.13).

maps  (Figure  7.14):  Maps  generally  display  spatial  information—for  example,  geographic  census  information.  This
information  often  comes  from  government  sources  (e.g.,  the  U.S.  Census  Bureau  or  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and
Prevention); to reprint or adapt tables or figures from these sources, see Section 12.16.

plots (Figures 7.15–7.16): Plots present individual data points as a function of axis variables. Common types of plots include
the scatterplot (Figure 7.15), which is used to explore the relationship between two variables (e.g., a linear relationship may
be indicated if the data points are clustered along the diagonal), and
multidimensional  scaling  (Figure  7.16),  in  which  similar  points  or  stimuli  are  presented  close  together  in  a
multidimensional space and those that are dissimilar appear farther apart.

photographs (Figure 7.17):  Photographs  (see  Section  7.30)  contain  direct  visual  representations  of  information.  They  are
often used to present information that would be difficult to portray effectively with drawings, such as facial expressions or
precise placement of stimuli in an environment.

Multipanel  Figures.  A  multipanel  figure  may  combine  bar  graphs,  line  graphs,  histograms,  and  other  figure  types  into  one
figure (see Figure 7.18 for an example; see also Section 7.26). Whether it is advisable to combine panels into one figure or to
present panels as separate figures will depend on the size of the figures and the nature of the information being presented.

Figures for Electrophysiological, Radiological, Genetic, and Other Biological Data. A variety of figures are used to present
biological data. These data include

event-related potentials (Figure 7.19),
fMRI data (Figure 7.20), and
genetic maps (Figure 7.21).

WOR K S C R ED ITED  IN  TH E TEXT

Scientific knowledge represents the accomplishments of many researchers over time. A critical part of writing in APA Style is
helping readers place your contribution in context by citing the researchers who influenced you.

In this chapter, we provide the ground rules for acknowledging how others contributed to your work. General guidance for in-
text citation is presented first, including how to provide an appropriate level of citation and avoid plagiarism and self-plagiarism
in your writing. Specific guidance for in-text citation follows, including formats for interviews, classroom and intranet sources,
and personal communications; in-text citations in general; and paraphrases and direct quotations.

General Guidelines for Citation

8.1 Appropriate Level of Citation

Cite the work of those individuals whose ideas, theories, or research have directly influenced your work. The works you cite
provide key background information, support or dispute your thesis, or offer critical definitions and data. Cite only works that
you have read and ideas that you have incorporated into your writing. Cite primary sources when possible and secondary sources
sparingly  (see  Section  8.6).  In  addition  to  crediting  the  ideas  of  others  that  you  used  to  develop  your  thesis,  provide
documentation for all facts and figures that are not common knowledge. Both paraphrases (see Sections 8.23–8.24)  and  direct
quotations (see Sections 8.25–8.35) require citations. If you reprint or adapt a table or figure (e.g., if you reproduce an image
from the internet, even if it was free or in the Creative Commons) or reprint a long quotation or commercially copyrighted test
item, you may also need to seek permission from the copyright holder and provide a copyright attribution (see Sections 12.14–
12.18).

The number of sources you cite in your paper depends on the purpose of your work. For most papers, cite one or two of the
most representative sources for each key point. Literature review papers, however, typically include a more exhaustive list of
references, given that the purpose of the paper is to acquaint readers with everything that has been written on the topic.

Avoid both undercitation and overcitation. Undercitation can lead to plagiarism (see Section 8.2) and/or self-plagiarism (see
Section 8.3). Even when sources cannot be retrieved (e.g., because they are personal communications; see Section 8.9), you still
need  to  credit  them  in  the  text  (however,  avoid  using  online  sources  that  are  no  longer  recoverable;  see  Section  9.37).
Overcitation can be distracting and is unnecessary. For example, it is considered overcitation to repeat the same citation in every
sentence when the source and topic have not changed. Instead, when paraphrasing a key point in more than one sentence within
a paragraph, cite the source in the first sentence in which it is relevant and do not repeat the citation in subsequent sentences as
long as the source remains clear and unchanged (see Section 8.24). When the author’s name appears in the narrative, the year
can  be  omitted  in  repeated  citations  under  certain  circumstances  (see  Section  8.16).  Figure  8.1  provides  an  example  of  an
appropriate level of citation.

Figure 8.1 Example of an Appropriate Level of Citation

Note. The authors have provided citations to representative sources for each new idea in the text. Common knowledge (here, the idea that some people come
up with funny ideas more easily than do others) does not require a citation.

Full Description.

8.2 Plagiarism
Plagiarism is the act of presenting the words, ideas, or images of another as your own; it denies authors or creators of content
the credit they are due. Whether deliberate or unintentional, plagiarism violates ethical standards in scholarship (see APA Ethics
Code Standard 8.11, Plagiarism). Writers who plagiarize disrespect the efforts of original authors by failing to acknowledge their
contributions,  stifle  further  research  by  preventing  readers  from  tracing  ideas  back  to  their  original  sources,  and  unfairly
disregard those who exerted the effort to complete their own work. Writers who try to publish plagiarized work face rejection
from publication and possible censure in their place of employment. Students who plagiarize may fail the assignment or course,
be placed on academic probation, or be expelled from their institution (see also Section 1.17).

To avoid plagiarism, provide appropriate credit to the source whenever you do the following:

paraphrase (i.e., state in your own words) the ideas of others (see Sections 8.23–8.24)

directly quote the words of others (see Sections 8.25–8.35)

refer to data or data sets (see Section 10.9)

reprint  or  adapt  a  table  or  figure,  even  images  from  the  internet  that  are  free  or  licensed  in  the  Creative  Commons  (see
Sections 12.14–12.18)

reprint a long text passage or commercially copyrighted test item (see Sections 12.14–12.18)

For  most  works,  appropriate  credit  takes  the  form  of  an  author–date  citation  (see  Section 8.10).  However,  according  to  U.S.
copyright  law,  authors  who  wish  to  reprint  or  adapt  tables,  figures,  and  images  or  to  reprint  long  quotations  or  commercially
copyrighted test items (see Section 12.15) must provide more comprehensive credit in the form of a copyright attribution (see
Section 12.18) and may need permission from the copyright holder to use the materials (see Section 12.17).

The necessity for credit extends to the ideas of others as well. For example, authors should credit the originators of theories
they refer to in their paper. If authors model a study after one conducted by someone else, the author of the original study should

271

be given credit. If the rationale for a study was suggested in someone else’s article, that person should be given credit. Given the
free exchange of ideas, which is important to the health of intellectual discourse, authors may not be able to pinpoint exactly
where the idea for their study originated. They should make their best effort to find and acknowledge the source(s), including
any personal communications (see Section 8.9).

Although many cases of plagiarism are straightforward (e.g., passages of text copied from another source without attribution),
other cases are more challenging to evaluate. Usually, using incorrect citations (e.g., misspelling an author’s name, forgetting or
mistyping  an  element  in  a  reference  list  entry,  or  citing  a  source  in  the  text  that  does  not  have  a  corresponding  reference  list
entry)  is  not  considered  plagiarism  if  the  error  is  minor  and  attributable  to  an  editorial  oversight  rather  than  an  intentional
attempt to steal someone’s ideas or obfuscate the origin of the information (Cooper, 2016). However, such errors may still result
in deductions on an academic assignment or a request for revision of a manuscript submitted for publication.

Publishers and educators may use plagiarism-checking software (e.g., iThenticate, Turnitin) to identify cases in which entire
papers have been copied, passages of specified lengths match, or a few words have been changed but content is largely the same
(the  latter  is  known  as  patchwriting;  see  Merriam-Webster,  n.d.-a).  However,  human  review  is  often  necessary  to  determine
whether plagiarism has actually taken place. Take careful notes as you research and write to keep track of and accurately cite
your sources. Check your work carefully to ensure that you acknowledge the words and ideas of others with citations in the text
that have corresponding reference list entries.

Unethical writing practices other than plagiarism are also prohibited. For example, it is unethical to fabricate citations and/or
reference  list  entries.  This  practice  gives  the  appearance  of  properly  credited  sources,  but  the  sources  are  fictitious  or
untraceable; the author may have made up the information as well as the sources, or the information may come from real works
that  have  not  been  credited.  Likewise,  contract cheating,  in  which  students  hire  another  person  to  write  a  paper  for  them,  is
unethical. Even when the resulting work is original (i.e., not plagiarized), these students still take credit for work that they did
not do themselves, which violates academic integrity policies, honor codes, and ethics codes.

8.3 Self-Plagiarism
Self-plagiarism  is  the  presentation  of  your  own  previously  published  work  as  original;  like  plagiarism,  self-plagiarism  is
unethical. Self-plagiarism deceives readers by making it appear that more information is available on a topic than really exists. It
gives the impression that findings are more replicable than is the case or that particular conclusions are more strongly supported
than  is  warranted  by  the  evidence.  It  may  lead  to  copyright  violations  if  you  publish  the  same  work  with  multiple  publishers
(sometimes called duplicate publication; see Section 1.16).

Some institutions may consider it self-plagiarism if a student submits a paper written for one class to complete an assignment
for  another  class  without  permission  from  the  current  instructor;  using  the  same  paper  in  multiple  classes  may  violate  the
academic  integrity  policy,  honor  code,  or  ethics  code  of  the  university.  However,  incorporating  previous  classwork  into  one’s
thesis or dissertation and building on one’s own existing writing may be permissible; students who wish to do this should discuss
their  ideas  with  their  instructor  or  advisor  and  follow  their  university’s  honor  code,  ethics  code,  or  academic  policies  when
reusing their previous work.

In specific circumstances, authors may wish to duplicate their previously used words without quotation marks or citation (e.g.,
in  describing  the  details  of  an  instrument  or  an  analytic  approach),  feeling  that  extensive  self-referencing  is  undesirable  or
awkward  and  that  rewording  may  lead  to  inaccuracies.  When  the  duplicated  material  is  limited  in  scope,  this  approach  is
permissible.

When  the  duplication  is  more  extensive,  authors  should  cite  the  source  of  the  duplicated  material.  What  constitutes  the
maximum acceptable length of duplicated material is difficult to define but must conform to legal notions of fair use (see Section
12.17). General guidelines for using an acceptable amount of duplicated material are as follows:

Ensure that the core of the new document constitutes an original contribution to knowledge in that

only the amount of previously published material necessary to understand that contribution is included and
the material appears primarily in the discussion of theory and methodology.

Place all duplicated material in a single paragraph or a few paragraphs, when feasible, with a citation at the beginning or end
of  each  paragraph.  Introduce  the  duplicated  material  with  a  phrase  such  as  “as  I  have  previously  discussed.”  Do  not  use
quotation marks or block quotation formatting around your own duplicated material.

When you reanalyze your own previously published data, such as in a large-scale, longitudinal, or multidisciplinary project,
provide sufficient information about the project so that readers can evaluate the current report but do not repeat every detail of
the design and method. Find a balance that involves referring readers to the earlier work using citations.

272

If a manuscript will receive masked review (see Section 12.7), you may need to conceal references to your previous work until
the  manuscript  is  ready  for  publication.  To  conceal  your  previous  work,  omit  the  relevant  entries  from  the  reference  list  and
indicate  in  the  text  where  citations  will  be  reinstated  after  the  review  process  by  including  “citation  omitted,”  or  similar,  in
parentheses.

An  exception  to  the  prohibition  against  self-plagiarism  is  publishing  a  work  of  limited  circulation  in  a  venue  of  wider
circulation. For example, authors may publish their doctoral dissertation or master’s thesis in whole or in part in one or more
journal articles. In such cases, authors would not cite their dissertation or thesis in the article text but rather acknowledge in the
author note that the work was based on their dissertation or thesis (see Section 2.7). Similarly, an article based on research the
authors  described  in  an  abstract  published  in  a  conference  program  or  proceeding  does  not  usually  constitute  duplicate
publication; the author should acknowledge previous presentation of the research in the article’s author note (see the author note
of the sample professional paper in Chapter 2 as an example). Seek clarification from the journal editor or course instructor if
you are concerned about duplicate publication or self-plagiarism.

8.4 Correspondence Between Reference List and Text
APA  Style  uses  the  author–date  citation  system  (see  Section  8.10),  in  which  a  brief  in-text  citation  directs  readers  to  a  full
reference list entry. Each work cited in the text must appear in the reference list, and each work in the reference list must be cited
in the text. Ensure that the spelling of author names and the publication dates in the reference list entries match those in the in-
text  citations.  The  date  element  of  a  reference  list  entry  may  include  the  month,  season,  and/or  day  in  addition  to  the  year;
however, the corresponding in-text citation includes only the year (see, e.g., Example 15 in Chapter 10).

There are a few exceptions to these guidelines:

Personal communications, which are unrecoverable sources, are cited in the text only (see Section 8.9).

General mentions of whole websites or periodicals (see Section 8.22) and common software and apps (see Section 10.10) in
the text do not require a citation or reference list entry.

The source of an epigraph does not usually appear in the reference list (see Section 8.35).

Quotations from your research participants can be presented and discussed in the text but do not need citations or reference
list entries (see Section 8.36).

References included in a meta-analysis, which are marked with an asterisk in the reference list, may be cited in the text (or
not) at the author’s discretion (see Section 9.52).

8.5 Use of the Published Version or Archival Version
Multiple versions of the same work might coexist on the internet, and you should cite the version of the work you used. Ideally,
use and cite the final, published version of a work (see Chapter 10, Examples 1–3). However, if  you  used  the  advance  online
version (see Chapter 10, Example 7), the in-press version (see Chapter 10, Example 8), or the final peer-reviewed manuscript
accepted for publication (but before it was typeset or copyedited; see Chapter 10, Example 73), cite that version. The final peer-
reviewed manuscript as accepted for publication might be available from a variety of places, including a personal website, an
employer’s server, an institutional repository, a reference manager, or an author social network.

Informally  published  works,  such  as  those  in  a  preprint  archive  (e.g.,  PsyArXiv)  or  an  institutional  repository  or  database
(e.g.,  ERIC),  can  also  be  cited  (see  Chapter  10,  Examples  73–74)  when  these  are  the  version  used.  Draft  manuscripts
(unpublished, in preparation, or submitted) can be cited when the draft is the most current version of the work (see Chapter 10,
Examples 70–72). When you cite a draft manuscript, in-press article, advance online publication, or informally published work
in your paper, ensure you have the most up-to-date publication information for these works and update the reference list entry if
necessary  before  you  submit  your  paper.  Publishers  label  advance  online  publications  in  various  ways  (e.g.,  “online  first
publication,” “advance online publication,” “epub ahead of print”); standardize this label to “advance online publication” for an
APA Style reference list entry (see Chapter 10, Example 7).

8.6 Primary and Secondary Sources
In  scholarly  work,  a  primary  source  reports  original  content;  a  secondary  source  refers  to  content  first  reported  in  another
source. Cite secondary sources sparingly—for instance, when the original work is out of print, unavailable, or available only in a
language that you do not understand. If possible, as a matter of good scholarly practice, find the primary source, read it, and cite

273

it  directly  rather  than  citing  a  secondary  source.  For  example,  rather  than  citing  an  instructor’s  lecture  or  a  textbook  or
encyclopedia  that  in  turn  cites  original  research,  find,  read,  and  cite  the  original  research  directly  (unless  an  instructor  has
directed you to do otherwise).

When citing a secondary source, provide a reference list entry for the secondary source that you used. In the text, identify the
primary source and then write “as cited in” the secondary source that you used. If the year of publication of the primary source is
known, also include it in the text. For example, if you read a work by Lyon et al. (2014) in which Rabbitt (1982) was cited, and
you were unable to read Rabbitt’s work yourself, cite Rabbitt’s work as the original source, followed by Lyon et al.’s work as the
secondary source. Only Lyon et al.’s work appears in the reference list.

(Rabbitt, 1982, as cited in Lyon et al., 2014)

If the year of the primary source is unknown, omit it from the in-text citation.

Works Requiring Special Approaches to Citation

8.7 Interviews

An interview is a dialogue or an exchange of information between people. Interviews used as sources can be classified into three
categories: published interviews, personal interviews, and research participant interviews.

Published  interviews  appear  in  a  variety  of  places—for  example,  in  a  magazine,  newspaper,  recorded  radio  broadcast,
podcast episode, YouTube video, TV show, or transcript of a video or audio recording. To cite a published interview, follow
the format for the reference type (e.g., magazine article, podcast episode, radio broadcast; see Chapter 10, Examples 15 and
95, for interviews published in a magazine article and a digital archive, respectively). The person being interviewed will not
necessarily appear in the author element of the reference; when this is case, integrate the person’s name into the narrative of
the sentence if desired (see Chapter 10, Example 88).

Personal interviews are those you conduct as a means of obtaining information to support a key point in your paper (e.g., an
email to an author inquiring about their published work). Because readers cannot recover this type of interview, cite it as a
personal communication (see Section 8.9).

Research  participant  interviews  are  those  you  conducted  as  part  of  your  methodology.  They  do  not  require  a  citation  in
APA  Style  because  you  do  not  cite  your  own  work  in  the  paper  in  which  it  is  being  first  reported.  However,  information
gathered from research participant interviews can be presented and discussed in a paper according to the guidelines in Section
8.36.

8.8 Classroom or Intranet Resources
Some works are recoverable only by certain audiences, which determines how they are cited. For example, a student writing a
paper for a course assignment might cite works from the classroom website or learning management system (LMS; e.g., Canvas,
Blackboard,  Brightspace,  Moodle,  Sakai),  or  an  employee  might  cite  resources  from  the  company  intranet  when  writing  an
internal  company  report.  These  sources  are  recoverable  by  the  instructor  and  fellow  students  or  by  other  employees  of  the
company but not the general public.

When the audience you are writing for can retrieve the works you used, cite the works using the formats shown in Chapter 10,
which  are  organized  according  to  reference  group  and  category.  For  example,  to  cite  a  recorded  lecture  or  PowerPoint
presentation  available  from  a  classroom  website  or  LMS  for  a  student  assignment,  follow  the  format  shown  in  Chapter  10,
Example 102. The source element of these references includes the name of the classroom website or LMS and the URL (which
for sites requiring users to log in should be the home page or login page URL). Likewise, for a report on a company intranet,
follow the report formats shown in Section 10.4. However, if the work is for professional publication or intended for a wider
audience who will not have access to these sources, cite the sources as personal communications (see Section 8.9).

8.9 Personal Communications
Works  that  cannot  be  recovered  by  readers  (i.e.,  works  without  a  source  element;  see  Section  9.4)  are  cited  in  the  text  as
personal communications.  Personal  communications  include  emails,  text  messages,  online  chats  or  direct  messages,  personal

274

interviews, telephone conversations, live speeches, unrecorded classroom lectures, memos, letters, messages from nonarchived
discussion groups or online bulletin boards, and so on.

Use a personal communication citation only when a recoverable source is not available. For example, if you learned about a
topic via a classroom lecture, it would be preferable to cite the research on which the instructor based the lecture. However, if
the  lecture  contained  original  content  not  published  elsewhere,  cite  the  lecture  as  a  personal  communication.  When
communications  are  recoverable  only  in  an  archive  (e.g.,  a  presidential  library),  cite  them  as  archival  materials  (see  the  APA
Style website at https://apastyle.apa.org for more). Do not use a personal communication citation for quotes or information from
participants whom you interviewed as part of your own original research (see Section 8.36).

Citing Personal Communications in the Text. Because readers cannot retrieve the information in personal communications,
personal communications are not included in the reference list; they are cited in the text only. Give the initial(s) and surname of
the communicator, and provide as exact a date as possible, using the following formats:

Narrative citation: E.-M. Paradis (personal communication, August 8, 2019)
Parenthetical citation: (T. Nguyen, personal communication, February 24, 2020)

Citing  Traditional  Knowledge  or  Oral  Traditions  of  Indigenous  Peoples. The  manner  of  citing  Traditional  Knowledge  or
Oral Traditions (other terms are “Traditional Stories” and “Oral Histories”) of Indigenous Peoples varies depending on whether
and how the information has been recorded—only certain cases use a variation of the personal communication citation. If the
information has been recorded and is recoverable by readers (e.g., video, audio, interview transcript, book, article), cite it in the
text  and  include  a  reference  list  entry  in  the  correct  format  for  that  type  of  source  (see  Section  10.12,  Example  90,  for  a
recording on YouTube; see Section 10.13, Example 95, for a recorded interview).

Examine  published  works  carefully  (especially  older  works)  to  ensure  that  the  information  about  Indigenous  Peoples  is
accurate  and  appropriate  to  share  before  citing  those  works.  Likewise,  work  closely  with  Indigenous  people  to  ensure  that
material is appropriate to publish (e.g., some stories are told only at certain times of year or by certain people and may not be
appropriate  to  publish  in  a  journal  article)  and  that  your  wording  accurately  mirrors  and  maintains  the  integrity  of  their
perspectives  (see  Younging,  2018,  for  more  on  the  nature  of  collaboration  with  Indigenous  people).  Likewise,  because
Indigenous cultural heritage belongs to Indigenous Peoples in perpetuity, matters concerning copyright and authorship may arise
depending on the scope and nature of the material being presented (see Younging, 2018, for more).

Capitalize most terms related to Indigenous Peoples. These include names of specific groups (e.g., Cherokee, Cree, Ojibwe) and
words related to Indigenous culture (e.g., Creation, the Creator, Elder, Oral Tradition, Traditional Knowledge, Vision Quest). The
capitalization is intentional and demonstrates respect for Indigenous perspectives (for more, see International Journal of Indigenous
Health, n.d.; Younging, 2018).

To  describe  Traditional  Knowledge  or  Oral  Traditions  that  are  not  recorded  (and  therefore  are  not  recoverable  by  readers),
provide  as  much  detail  in  the  in-text  citation  as  is  necessary  to  describe  the  content  and  to  contextualize  the  origin  of  the
information. Because there is no recoverable source, a reference list entry is not used.

If the purpose of your paper is to present the Oral History of one or more of your research participants, follow the guidelines
in Section 8.36 for including quotations from research participants. If the paper is published, this Oral History then becomes part
of the recorded scholarly literature and can thus be cited by others using standard formats.

If you spoke with an Indigenous person directly to learn information (but they were not a research participant), use a variation
of  the  personal  communication  citation:  Provide  the  person’s  full  name  and  the  nation  or  specific  Indigenous  group  to  which
they belong, as well as their location or other details about them as relevant, followed by the words “personal communication,”
and the date of the communication. Provide an exact date of correspondence if available; if correspondence took place over a
period of time, provide a more general date or a range of dates. (The date refers to when you consulted with the person, not to
when  the  information  originated.)  Ensure  that  the  person  agrees  to  have  their  name  included  in  your  paper  and  confirms  the
accuracy and appropriateness of the information you present.

We spoke with Anna Grant (Haida Nation, lives in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, personal communication, April 2019) about
traditional understandings of the world by First Nations Peoples in Canada. She described . . .

275

If you are an Indigenous person and are sharing your own experiences or the previously unrecorded Traditional Knowledge or
Oral Tradition of your people, describe yourself in the text (e.g., what nation you belong to, where you live) to contextualize the
origin of the information you are sharing. Do not use a personal communication citation or provide a reference list entry because
you  do  not  need  to  cite  personal  information.  It  is  often  useful  to  collaborate  with  other  Indigenous  people  to  address  any
questions that may arise. For more on the terms to use when describing Indigenous Peoples, see Section 5.7.

In-Text Citations

8.10 Author–Date Citation System

Use the author–date citation system to cite references in the text in APA Style. In this system, each work used in a paper has two
parts: an in-text citation and a corresponding reference list entry (see Figure 8.2). The in-text citation appears within the body of
the paper (or in a table, figure, footnote, or appendix) and briefly identifies the cited work by its author and date of publication.
This in-text citation enables readers to locate the corresponding entry in the alphabetical reference list at the end of the paper.
Each reference list entry provides the author, date, title, and source of the work cited in the paper and enables readers to identify
and retrieve the work (see Chapter 9 for how to create and order reference list entries).

Figure 8.2 Correspondence Between a Reference List Entry and an In-Text Citation

Note. The four elements of a reference list entry include the author (in purple), the date (in blue), the title (in yellow), and the source (in green). The in-text
citations that correspond to this reference include the last name of the author and year of publication, which match the information in the reference list entry.

Full Description.

In an in-text citation, provide the surname(s) of the author(s) or the name(s) of the group author(s). Do not include suffixes
such as “Jr.” in the in-text citation. (For authors with only one name or only a username, see Section 9.8.) The list of authors in
an  in-text  citation  may  be  shortened  in  certain  cases  (for  individual  authors,  see  Section 8.17;  for  group  authors,  see  Section
8.21). To create an in-text citation for a work with an unknown or anonymous author, see Section 8.14.

The date in the in-text citation should match the date in the reference list entry. Use only the year in the in-text citation, even if
the reference list entry contains a more specific date (e.g., year, month, and day). For works with no date, use “n.d.” in the in-text
citation  (see  also  Section  9.17);  for  works  that  have  been  accepted  for  publication  but  have  not  yet  been  published,  use  “in
press.” Do not use phrases like “in progress” for draft manuscripts; instead, use the year the draft was written (see Section 10.8).

276

Each in-text citation must correspond to only one reference list entry. Avoid ambiguity when abbreviating the list of authors
(see Sections 8.17 and 8.21), when multiple works have the same author(s) and date (see Section 8.19), and when multiple first
authors share the same surname (see Section 8.20).

8.11 Parenthetical and Narrative Citations
In-text citations have two formats: parenthetical and narrative. In parenthetical citations, the author name and publication date
(or equivalent information; see Section 9.12) appear in parentheses. In narrative citations, this information is incorporated into
the text as part of the sentence.

Parenthetical Citation. Both the author and the date, separated by a comma, appear in parentheses for a parenthetical citation.
A parenthetical citation can appear within or at the end of a sentence. When a parenthetical citation is at the end of a sentence,
put the period or other end punctuation after the closing parenthesis.

Falsely balanced news coverage can distort the public’s perception of expert consensus on an issue (Koehler, 2016).

If other text appears with the parenthetical citation, use commas around the year.

(see Koehler, 2016, for more detail)

When text and a citation appear together in parentheses, use a semicolon to separate the citation from the text; do not use
parentheses within parentheses.

(e.g., falsely balanced news coverage; Koehler, 2016)

Narrative Citation. The author appears in running text and the date appears in parentheses immediately after the author name
for a narrative citation.

Koehler (2016) noted the dangers of falsely balanced news coverage.

In rare cases, the author and date might both appear in the narrative. In this case, do not use parentheses.

In 2016, Koehler noted the dangers of falsely balanced news coverage.

8.12 Citing Multiple Works
When citing multiple works parenthetically, place the citations in alphabetical order, separating them with semicolons. Listing
both parenthetical in-text citations and reference list entries in alphabetical order helps readers locate and retrieve works because
they are listed in the same order in both places.

(Adams et al., 2019; Shumway & Shulman, 2015; Westinghouse, 2017)

Arrange two or more works by the same authors by year of publication. Place citations with no date first, followed by works
with dates in chronological order; in-press citations appear last. Give the authors’ surnames once; for each subsequent work,
give only the date.

(Department of Veterans Affairs, n.d., 2017a, 2017b, 2019)
Zhou (n.d., 2000, 2016, in press)

In  the  case  of  multiple  works  in  which  some  author  names  have  been  abbreviated  to  “et  al.”  (see  Section 8.17),  place  the
citations in chronological order (regardless of the order in which they appear in the reference list).

(Carraway et al., 2013, 2014, 2019)

To highlight the work(s) most directly relevant to your point in a given sentence, place those citations first within parentheses
in alphabetical order and then insert a semicolon and a phrase, such as “see also,” before the first of the remaining citations,
which should also be in alphabetical order. This strategy allows authors to emphasize, for example, the most recent or most
important research on a topic, which would not be reflected by alphabetical order alone.

(Sampson & Hughes, 2020; see also Augustine, 2017; Melara et al., 2018; Pérez, 2014)

Readers may find a long string of citations difficult to parse, especially if they are using assistive technology such as a screen
reader;  therefore,  include  only  those  citations  needed  to  support  your  immediate  point  (for  more  on  appropriate  level  of

277

citation, see Section 8.1).

If multiple sources are cited within the narrative of a sentence, they can appear in any order.

Suliman (2018), Gutiérrez (2012, 2017), and Medina and Reyes (2019) examined . . .

8.13 Citing Specific Parts of a Source
To cite a specific part of a source, provide an author–date citation for the work plus information about the specific part. There
are many possible parts to cite, including

pages, paragraphs, sections, tables, figures, supplemental materials, or footnotes from an article, book, report, webpage, or
other work;

chapters, forewords, or other sections of authored books;

time stamps of videos or audiobooks; and

slide numbers in PowerPoint presentations.

For religious and classical works with canonically numbered parts common across editions (e.g., books, chapters, verses, lines,
cantos), cite the part instead of a page number (see Section 9.42).

(Shakespeare, 1623/1995, 1.3.36–37)

In the reference list, provide an entry for the entire work (not only the part that you used).

It is possible to cite a specific part of a source whether you are paraphrasing (see Sections 8.23–8.24) or directly quoting (see
Sections 8.25–8.27). For further guidance on quoting works without page numbers (e.g., webpages, websites, audiovisual works)
and religious and classical works with canonically numbered sections, see Section 8.28.

8.14 Unknown or Anonymous Author
When the author of a work is not named, the author may be unknown (i.e., no author is listed on the work, as with a religious
work) or identified specifically as “Anonymous.” For works with an unknown author (see Section 9.12),  include  the  title  and
year of publication in the in-text citation (note that the title moves to the author position in the reference list entry as well). If the
title of the work is italicized in the reference, also italicize the title in the in-text citation. If the title of the work is not italicized
in the reference, use double quotation marks around the title in the in-text citation. Capitalize these titles in the text using title
case (see Section 6.17), even though sentence case is used in the reference list entry. If the title is long, shorten it for the in-text
citation.

Book with no author: (Interpersonal Skills, 2019)
Magazine article with no author: (“Understanding Sensory Memory,” 2018)

When the author of a work is overtly designated as “Anonymous” (see Section 9.12), “Anonymous” takes the place of the author
name in the in-text citation.

(Anonymous, 2017)

8.15 Translated, Reprinted, Republished, and Reissued Dates
References  to  translated,  reprinted,  republished,  or  reissued  works  (see  Sections  9.39–9.41)  contain  two  dates  in  the  in-text
citation:  the  year  of  publication  of  the  original  work  and  the  year  of  publication  of  the  translation,  reprint,  republication,  or

278

reissue. Separate the years with a slash, with the earlier year first (see Chapter 10, Example 29).

Freud (1900/1953)
(Piaget, 1966/2000)

8.16 Omitting the Year in Repeated Narrative Citations
In general, include the author and date in every in-text citation. If you need to repeat a citation (see Section 8.1), repeat the entire
citation; do not, for example, include only a page number (the abbreviation “ibid.” is not used in APA Style). The year can be
omitted from a citation only when multiple narrative citations to a work appear within a single paragraph (see Figure 8.3 for an
example).

Figure 8.3  Example of Repeated Narrative Citations With the Year Omitted

Full Description.

Once you have provided a narrative citation to a work in a paragraph, do not repeat the year in subsequent narrative citations
in that same paragraph. Follow this guideline with each paragraph (i.e., include the year in the first narrative citation in a new
paragraph). Include the year in every parenthetical citation.

However, if you cite multiple works by the same author or authors, regardless of the publication years, include the date in
every  in-text  citation  to  prevent  ambiguity.  For  example,  if  you  cite  Mohammed  and  Mahfouz  (2017)  and  Mohammed  and
Mahfouz  (2019),  include  the  year  with  every  citation,  even  when  one  of  the  references  is  cited  multiple  times  in  a  single
paragraph.

279

8.17 Number of Authors to Include in In-Text Citations
The format of the author element of the in-text citation changes depending on the number of authors and is abbreviated in some
cases. See Table 8.1 for examples of the basic in-text citation styles.

For a work with one or two authors, include the author name(s) in every citation.

For a work with three or more authors, include the name of only the first author plus “et al.” in every citation, including the
first citation, unless doing so would create ambiguity (see Section 8.18).

Stanford University (2020)

a Define the abbreviation for a group author only once in the text, choosing either the parenthetical or the narrative format. Thereafter, use the abbreviation for
all mentions of the group in the text (see Section 8.21).

In parenthetical citations, use an ampersand (&) between names for a work with two authors or before the last author when all
names must be included to avoid ambiguity (see Section 8.18). In narrative citations, spell out the word “and.”

(Jöreskog & Sörbom, 2007)
Eifert and Yildiz (2018)

In tables and figures, use an ampersand between names in both parenthetical and narrative citations.

The same guidelines apply when any of the authors are groups. For example, if a work is authored by three groups, the in-text

citation would include the name of the first group plus “et al.”

(American Educational Research Association et al., 2014)

8.18 Avoiding Ambiguity in In-Text Citations
Sometimes multiple works with three or more authors and the same publication year shorten to the same in-text citation form
when  the  guidelines  described  in  Section  8.17  are  applied,  which  creates  ambiguity.  To  avoid  ambiguity,  when  the  in-text
citations  of  multiple  works  with  three  or  more  authors  shorten  to  the  same  form,  write  out  as  many  names  as  needed  to
distinguish the references, and abbreviate the rest of the names to “et al.” in every citation. For example, two works have the
following authors:

Kapoor, Bloom, Montez, Warner, and Hill (2017)
Kapoor, Bloom, Zucker, Tang, Köroğlu, L’Enfant, Kim, and Daly (2017)

Both  these  citations  shorten  to  Kapoor  et  al.  (2017).  To  avoid  ambiguity  when  citing  them  both  in  your  paper,  cite  them  as
follows:

Kapoor, Bloom, Montez, et al. (2017)
Kapoor, Bloom, Zucker, et al. (2017)

Because “et al.” is  plural  (meaning  “and  others”),  it  cannot  stand  for  only  one  name.  When  only  the  final  author  is  different,
spell out all names in every citation.

Hasan, Liang, Kahn, and Jones-Miller (2015)
Hasan, Liang, Kahn, and Weintraub (2015)

280

8.19 Works With the Same Author and Same Date
When multiple references have an identical author (or authors) and publication year, include a lowercase letter after the year (see
Section 9.47). The year–letter combination is used in both the in-text citation and the reference list entry. Use only the year with
a letter in the in-text citation, even if the reference list entry contains a more specific date.

(Judge & Kammeyer-Mueller, 2012a)

Judge and Kammeyer-Mueller (2012b)

(Sifuentes, n.d.-a, n.d.-b)

8.20 Authors With the Same Surname
If the first authors of multiple references share the same surname but have different initials, include the first authors’ initials in
all in-text citations, even if the year of publication differs. Initials help avoid confusion within the text and help readers locate
the correct entry in the reference list (see Section 9.48).

(J. M. Taylor & Neimeyer, 2015; T. Taylor, 2014)

If the first authors of multiple references share the same surname and the same initials, cite the works in the standard author–date
format.

Sometimes people publish under multiple names because of a name change (e.g., transgender authors, authors with a change
in marital status). It is seldom relevant to note that two names refer to the same person. When a given name has changed, include
initials  with  in-text  citations  only  when  the  initials  are  different.  If  it  is  necessary  to  clarify  that  two  names  refer  to  the  same
person (e.g., to avoid confusion when reviewing an author’s body of work), consult the person and respect their preferences in
whether  and  how  to  address  the  name  change.  If  it  is  necessary  to  clarify  that  two  names  refer  to  different  people  to  avoid
confusion,  include  the  first  name  of  the  first  author  in  the  in-text  citation:  “Sarah  Williams  (2019)  stated  X,  whereas  Shonda
Williams (2020) stated Y.”
If multiple authors within a single reference share the same surname, the initials are not needed in the in-text citation; cite the
work in the standard author–date format.

(Chen & Chen, 2019)

8.21 Abbreviating Group Authors
If a reference has a group author, the name of the group can sometimes be abbreviated—for example, “American Psychological
Association” can be abbreviated to “APA.” You are not obligated to abbreviate the name of a group author, but you can if the
abbreviation is well-known, will help avoid cumbersome repetition, or will appear at least three times in the paper.

As with other abbreviations (see Section 6.25), provide the full name of the group on first mention in the text, followed by the
abbreviation.

If the group name first appears in a narrative citation, include the abbreviation before the year in parentheses, separated with a
comma.

The American Psychological Association (APA, 2017) described . . .

If the group name first appears in a parenthetical citation, include the abbreviation in square brackets, followed by a comma
and the year.

(American Psychological Association [APA], 2017)

In the reference list entry, do not abbreviate the group author name. Instead, spell out the full name of the group as presented
in the source.

American

Psychological

Association.

(2017,

January).

Understanding

and

overcoming

opioid

abuse.

https://www.apa.org/helpcenter/opioid-abuse.aspx

If several references have the same group author, introduce the abbreviation only once in the text.

In the rare case that two different groups abbreviate to the same form (e.g., both the American Psychological Association and
the American Psychiatric Association abbreviate to “APA”) and you cite both groups in your paper, spell out each name every
time to avoid confusion.

281

If a work has three or more group authors, the in-text citation is also shortened as described in Section 8.17.

8.22 General Mentions of Websites, Periodicals, and Common Software and Apps
For a general mention of a website with no indication of particular information or a specific page from that site, no reference list
entry or in-text citation is needed. Provide the name of the website in the text and include the URL in parentheses. For example,
if you used a website to create a survey, mention the website in the text.

We created our survey using Qualtrics (https://www.qualtrics.com).

A variation of this technique is also used for general mentions of periodicals. For example, if you want to include the name of a
journal you searched during a meta-analysis, provide the journal title (in italic) using title case.

I searched the Journal of Abnormal Psychology for studies to include in the meta-analysis.

Common software and mobile apps are treated in a similar manner; in most cases, it is sufficient to mention the name of the
program  or  app  and  the  version  used  (if  known)  in  the  text,  without  providing  an  in-text  citation  or  reference  list  entry  (see
Section 10.10). Likewise, for apparatuses, provide a reference for specialized products only (see Section 10.10).

Paraphrases and Quotations

8.23 Principles of Paraphrasing

A paraphrase restates another’s idea (or your own previously published idea) in your own words. Paraphrasing is an effective
writing  strategy  because  it  allows  authors  to  summarize  and  synthesize  information  from  one  or  more  sources,  focus  on
significant information, and compare and contrast relevant details. Published authors paraphrase their sources most of the time,
rather than directly quoting the sources; student authors should emulate this practice by paraphrasing more than directly quoting.
Use a professional tone when describing a concept, idea, or finding in your own words (see Section 4.7).

Cite the work you paraphrase in the text using either the narrative or parenthetical format (see Section 8.11).

Avid readers of science fiction and fantasy books are more likely than readers of other genres to believe in futuristic scenarios—for
example, that it will someday be possible to travel to other galaxies or power a car on solar energy (Black et al., 2018).

Although  it  is  not  required  to  provide  a  page  or  paragraph  number  in  the  citation  for  a  paraphrase,  you  may  include  one  in
addition to the author and year when it would help interested readers locate the relevant passage within a long or complex work
(e.g., a book).

Webster-Stratton (2016) described a case example of a 4-year-old girl who showed an insecure attachment to her mother; in working
with the family dyad, the therapist focused on increasing the mother’s empathy for her child (pp. 152–153).

The  guidelines  in  this  section  pertain  to  when  authors  read  a  primary  source  and  paraphrase  it  themselves.  If  you  read  a
paraphrase of a primary source in a published work and want to cite that source, it is best to read and cite the primary source
directly if possible; if not, use a secondary source citation (see Section 8.6).

8.24 Long Paraphrases
A paraphrase may continue for several sentences. In such cases, cite the work being paraphrased on first mention. Once the work
has been cited, it is not necessary to repeat the citation as long as the context of the writing makes it clear that the same work
continues to be paraphrased (see Figure 8.4 for an example). The citation may be either parenthetical or narrative; if you select
the narrative approach and repeat the author names in the narrative of subsequent sentences, the year of the work can often be
omitted (see Section 8.16).

282

Figure 8.4  Example of a Long Paraphrase With a Single In-Text Citation

Full Description.

If the paraphrase continues into a new paragraph, reintroduce the citation. If the paraphrase incorporates multiple sources or
switches among sources, repeat the citation so the source is clear (see Figure 8.5 for an example). Read your sentences carefully
to ensure you have cited sources appropriately.

283

Figure 8.5  Example of Repeated Citations Necessary to Clarify Sources

Note. In this passage, some works are cited multiple times to support multiple points. It is necessary to repeat these citations because different combinations
of works support different ideas—the sources change and thus must be made clear to readers. If all ideas had the same sources, it would not be necessary to
repeat the citations.

Full Description.

8.25 Principles of Direct Quotation
A direct quotation  reproduces  words  verbatim  from  another  work  or  from  your  own  previously  published  work.  It  is  best  to
paraphrase sources (see Sections 8.23–8.24) rather than directly quoting them because paraphrasing allows you to fit material to
the context of your paper and writing style. Use direct quotations rather than paraphrasing when reproducing an exact definition
(see example in Section 6.22),  when  an  author  has  said  something  memorably  or  succinctly,  or  when  you  want  to  respond  to
exact wording (e.g., something someone said). Instructors, programs, editors, and publishers may establish limits on the use of
direct quotations. Consult with your instructor or editor if you are concerned that you may have too much quoted material in
your paper.

When  quoting  directly,  always  provide  the  author,  year,  and  page  number  of  the  quotation  in  the  in-text  citation  in  either
parenthetical or narrative format (see Section 8.11). To indicate a single page, use the abbreviation “p.” (e.g., p. 25, p. S41, p.
e221); for multiple pages, use the abbreviation “pp.” and separate the page range with an en dash (e.g., pp. 34–36). If pages are
discontinuous,  use  a  comma  between  the  page  numbers  (e.g.,  pp.  67,  72).  If  the  work  does  not  have  page  numbers,  provide
another way for the reader to locate the quotation (see Section 8.28).

The format of a direct quotation depends on its length (fewer than 40 words vs. 40 words or more; see Sections 8.26–8.27).
Regardless  of  quotation  length,  do  not  insert  an  ellipsis  at  the  beginning  and/or  end  of  a  quotation  unless  the  original  source
includes an ellipsis. If you need to make changes to a direct quotation, see Sections 8.30 and 8.31. For other uses of quotation
marks, such as when presenting verbatim instructions to participants or quotations from research participants, see Sections 6.7
and 8.36, respectively. To reproduce material that is already a direct quotation in the work you are citing, see Section 8.33.

8.26 Short Quotations (Fewer Than 40 Words)
If  a  quotation  consists  of  fewer  than  40  words,  treat  it  as  a  short  quotation:  Incorporate  it  into  the  text  and  enclose  it  within
double quotation marks. For a direct quotation, always include a full citation (parenthetical or narrative) in the same sentence as

284

the quotation. Place a parenthetical citation either immediately after the quotation or at the end of the sentence. For a narrative
citation, include the author and year in the sentence and then place the page number or other location information in parentheses
after the quotation; if the quotation precedes the narrative citation, put the page number or location information after the year and
a comma.

If  the  citation  appears  at  the  end  of  a  sentence,  put  the  end  punctuation  after  the  closing  parenthesis  for  the  citation.  If  the
quotation includes citations, see Section 8.32;  if  the  quotation  includes  material  already  in  quotation  marks,  see Section 8.33.
Place  periods  and  commas  within  closing  single  or  double  quotation  marks.  Place  other  punctuation  marks  inside  quotation
marks only when they are part of the quoted material.

Short quotations can be presented in a variety of ways, as shown in Table 8.2.

as the year when the
quotation precedes the

The question mark that ends
the quotation should appear
within the quotation marks.

It is not necessary to repeat
the author and year within
parentheses when they
already appear in the

8.27 Block Quotations (40 Words or More)
If a quotation contains 40 words or more, treat it as a block quotation. Do not use quotation marks to enclose a block quotation.
Start a block quotation on a new line and indent the whole block 0.5 in. from the left margin. If there are additional paragraphs
within  the  quotation,  indent  the  first  line  of  each  subsequent  paragraph  an  additional  0.5  in.  Double-space  the  entire  block
quotation; do not add extra space before or after it. Either (a) cite the source in parentheses after the quotation’s final punctuation
or  (b)  cite  the  author  and  year  in  the  narrative  before  the  quotation  and  place  only  the  page  number  in  parentheses  after  the
quotation’s final punctuation. Do not add a period after the closing parenthesis in either case.

Block quotation with parenthetical citation:
Researchers have studied how people talk to themselves:

Inner speech is a paradoxical phenomenon. It is an experience that is central to many people’s everyday lives, and yet it presents
considerable challenges to any effort to study it scientifically. Nevertheless, a wide range of methodologies and approaches have
combined to shed light on the subjective experience of inner speech and its cognitive and neural underpinnings. (Alderson-Day &
Fernyhough, 2015, p. 957)

Block quotation with narrative citation:

285

Flores  et  al.  (2018)  described  how  they  addressed  potential  researcher  bias  when  working  with  an  intersectional  community  of
transgender people of color:

Everyone  on  the  research  team  belonged  to  a  stigmatized  group  but  also  held  privileged  identities.  Throughout  the  research
process,  we  attended  to  the  ways  in  which  our  privileged  and  oppressed  identities  may  have  influenced  the  research  process,
findings, and presentation of results. (p. 311)

Block quotation consisting of two paragraphs:
Regarding implications for chronic biases in expectation formation,

in  order  to  accurately  estimate  whether  people  are  likely  to  form  positive  or  negative  expectations  on  any  given  occasion,  it  is
necessary to go beyond simply considering chronic individual differences and identify the factors that make people more likely to
form expectations in line with one bias or the other.

The  present  research  sheds  light  on  this  issue  by  identifying  a  crucial  distinction  in  the  operation  of  these  two  trait  biases  in
expectation  formation.  Specifically,  people’s  valence  weighting  biases  and  self-beliefs  about  the  future  appear  to  shape
expectations via qualitatively distinct processes. (Niese et al., 2019, p. 210)

If the block quotation includes citations, see Section 8.32; if the block quotation includes material already in quotation marks,
see Section 8.33.

8.28 Direct Quotation of Material Without Page Numbers
Textual Works. To directly quote from written material that does not contain page numbers (e.g., webpages and websites, some
ebooks), provide readers with another way of locating the quoted passage. Any of the following approaches is acceptable; use
the approach that will best help readers find the quotation:

Provide a heading or section name.

For people with osteoarthritis, “painful joints should be moved through a full range of motion every day to maintain flexibility and to
slow deterioration of cartilage” (Gecht-Silver & Duncombe, 2015, Osteoarthritis section).

Provide an abbreviated heading or section name in quotation marks to indicate the abbreviation if the full heading or section
name is too long or unwieldy to cite in full. In the next example, the original heading was “What Can You Do to Prevent
Kidney Failure?” and the items are quoted separately because they originally appeared as part of a bulleted list.

To prevent kidney failure, patients should “get active,” “quit smoking,” and “take medications as directed” (Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, 2017, “What Can You Do” section).

Provide a paragraph number (count the paragraphs manually if they are not numbered).

People  planning  for  retirement  need  more  than  just  money—they  also  “need  to  stockpile  their  emotional  reserves”  to  ensure
adequate support from family and friends (Chamberlin, 2014, para. 1).

Provide a heading or section name in combination with a paragraph number.

Music and language are intertwined in the brain such that “people who are better at rhythmic memory skills tend to excel at language
skills as well” (DeAngelis, 2018, Musical Forays section, para. 4).

Do  not  include  Kindle  location  numbers  with  in-text  citations.  Instead,  provide  the  page  number  (which  is  available  in  many
Kindle  books,  especially  those  based  on  print  editions)  or  use  the  methods  described  in  this  section  to  create  a  page  number
alternative.

Note that the name of the section or other part of the work will not necessarily appear in the reference list entry for the work.
For example, if you cite a particular section of a webpage or website in the text, the reference list entry should be for the page
you used, not for only that section of the page.

Audiovisual  Works.  To  directly  quote  from  an  audiovisual  work  (e.g.,  audiobook,  YouTube  video,  TED  Talk,  TV  show),
provide a time stamp for the beginning of the quotation in place of a page number.

People make “sweeping inferences and judgments from body language” (Cuddy, 2012, 2:12).

Works  With  Canonically  Numbered  Sections.  To  directly  quote  from  material  with  canonically  numbered  sections  (e.g.,
religious or classical works; see also Section 9.42 and Chapter 10, Examples 35–37), use the name of the book, chapter, verse,
line, and/or canto instead of a page number.

The person vowed to “set me as a seal upon thine heart” (King James Bible, 1769/2017, Song of Solomon 8:6).

286

For plays, cite the act, scene, and line(s). In the following example, “1.3.36–37” refers to Act 1, Scene 3, Lines 36 and 37.

In  Much  Ado  About  Nothing,  Don  John  said,  “In  the  meantime  /  let  me  be  that  I  am  and  seek  not  to  alter  me”  (Shakespeare,
1623/1995, 1.3.36–37).

8.29 Accuracy of Quotations
Direct quotations must be accurate. Except as noted here and in Sections 8.30 and 8.31, the quotation must match the wording,
spelling, and interior punctuation of the original source, even if the source is incorrect. If any incorrect spelling, punctuation, or
grammar in the source might confuse readers, insert the word “[sic],” italicized and in brackets, immediately after the error in
the quotation. (See Section 8.31 regarding the use of square brackets to clarify meaning in quotations.) A quotation that includes
an  error  may  be  distracting,  so  consider  paraphrasing  instead.  When  quoting,  always  check  your  paper  against  the  source  to
ensure that there are no discrepancies.

Nowak (2019) wrote that “people have an obligation to care for there [sic] pets” (p. 52).

8.30 Changes to a Quotation Requiring No Explanation
Some changes can be made to direct quotations without alerting readers:

The first letter of the first word in a quotation may be changed to an uppercase or a lowercase letter to fit the context of the
sentence in which the quotation appears.

Some punctuation marks at the end of a quotation may be changed to fit the syntax of the sentence in which the quotation
appears, as long as meaning is not changed (e.g., it might alter meaning to change a period to a question mark, depending on
how the sentence is written).

Single quotation marks may be changed to double quotation marks and vice versa.

Footnote or endnote number callouts can be omitted (see also Section 8.32).

Any other changes (e.g., italicizing words for emphasis or omitting words; see Section 8.31) must be explicitly indicated. For
more on quoting from a bulleted list without reproducing the bullets, see the second example in Section 8.28.

8.31 Changes to a Quotation Requiring Explanation
Some changes to direct quotations require explanation, as shown in the example in Figure 8.6.

287

Figure 8.6 Example of Changes Made to a Direct Quotation

Note. In this passage, some works are cited multiple times to support multiple points. It is necessary to repeat these citations because different combinations
of works support different ideas—the sources change and thus must be made clear to readers. If all ideas had the same sources, it would not be necessary to
repeat the citations.

Full Description.

Omitting Material. Use an ellipsis to indicate that you have omitted words within a quotation (e.g., to shorten a sentence or tie
two sentences together). Either type three periods with spaces around each ( . . . ) or use the ellipsis character created by your
word-processing program when you type three periods in a row ( … ), with a space before and after. Do not use an ellipsis at the
beginning or end of any quotation unless the original source includes an ellipsis; start or end the quotation at the point where the
source’s text begins or ends. Use four periods—that is, a period plus an ellipsis (. … )—to show a sentence break within omitted
material, such as when a quotation includes the end of one sentence and the beginning of another sentence.

Inserting  Material.  Use  square  brackets,  not  parentheses,  to  enclose  material  such  as  an  addition  or  explanation  you  have
inserted in a quotation.

Adding Emphasis. If you want to emphasize a word or words in a quotation, use italics. Immediately after the italicized words,
insert “emphasis added” within square brackets as follows: [emphasis added].

8.32 Quotations That Contain Citations to Other Works
When quoting material that contains embedded citations, include the citations within the quotation. Do not include these works
in the reference list unless you cite them as primary sources elsewhere in your paper. In the following example, Panero et al.
(2016) would appear in the reference list, but the Stanislavski citations would not:

Actors “are encouraged to become immersed in a character’s life (Stanislavski, 1936/1948, 1950), an activity that calls for absorption”
(Panero et al., 2016, p. 234).

Footnote or endnote number callouts in the quoted material can be omitted with no explanation (see Section 8.30).

If citations appear at the end of material you want to quote, it is common practice to end the quotation before the citations and
to cite only the work you read (see Figure 8.7 for an example). It is appropriate to omit the citations at the end of a quotation

288

when the material you quote represents a new approach to or conceptualization of the ideas presented in the cited works—for
example, when authors have summarized a body of work and you want to quote and cite that summary. If you want to quote the
same material that was quoted in the work you are citing, see Section 8.33.

Figure 8.7  Example of Citations Omitted at the End of a Quotation

Note. In the original passage, Killham et al. (2018) summarized the results of many studies and cited their sources at the end of the sentence. To quote
Killham et al.’s summary in your paper, cite Killham et al., and omit the citations at the end of the original sentence. Interested readers can consult Killham et
al. for further information.

Full Description.

8.33 Quotations That Contain Material Already in Quotation Marks
If your source includes a direct quotation from another work, and you would like to use the same direct quotation in your paper,
it is best to read and cite the original source directly. If the original source is unavailable, cite the quotation using the secondary
source (see Section 8.6).

To  quote  material  that  already  uses  quotation  marks  for  some  other  purpose  (e.g.,  to  enclose  a  phrase  such  as  a  coined
expression or linguistic example; see Section 6.7), it may be necessary to change double quotation marks to single or vice versa
in your paper depending on the number of words you are quoting.

Short Quotations. For quotations of fewer than 40 words, use single quotation marks within double quotation marks to set off
material that was enclosed in double quotation marks in the original source.

289

Correct:  Bliese  et  al.  (2017)  noted  that  “mobile  devices  enabled  employees  in  many  jobs  to  work  ‘anywhere,  anytime’  and  stay
electronically tethered to work outside formal working hours” (p. 391).

Incorrect:  Bliese  et  al.  (2017)  noted  that  “mobile  devices  enabled  employees  in  many  jobs  to  work  “anywhere,  anytime”  and  stay
electronically tethered to work outside formal working hours” (p. 391).

Block Quotations. Use double quotation marks around quoted material that appears within a block quotation. (If the original
quotation marks were single quotation marks, as in British-style publications, change them to double quotation marks in your
paper.)

Correct:
It is also worth considering the need for subjective certainty:

If  a  conjecture  is  just  mere  guess,  one  would  not  expect  the  same  bias  to  occur,  because  it  might  likely  come  along  with  the
metacognition of “I know I am/was just guessing,” which would counteract retrospectively increased perceptions of foreseeability.
(von der Beck & Cress, 2018, p. 97)

metacognition of ‘I know I am/was just guessing,’ which would counteract retrospectively increased perceptions of foreseeability.
(von der Beck & Cress, 2018, p. 97)

8.34 Permission to Reprint or Adapt Lengthy Quotations
You may need written permission from the owner of a copyrighted work if you include lengthy quotations (usually more than
800 words) from it in your work. Quotations from shorter works (e.g., poems, songs) may also need permission. See Sections
12.14 to 12.18 for guidelines on citing these quotations.

8.35 Epigraphs
An epigraph is a quotation that is used to introduce an article, book, chapter, dissertation, or other work. Authors may use an
epigraph to set the stage for what follows or to serve as a summary or counterpoint. The epigraph should appear before the first
line of text and should be indented 0.5 in. from the left margin, like a block quotation, without quotation marks.

The source of an epigraph is not usually listed in the reference list unless the work is cited elsewhere in the text of the paper or
is important within the context of the topic. If the source of the epigraph is not included in the reference list, on the line below
the quotation, provide the credit line—consisting of an em dash and then the author’s full name, a comma, and the title of the
work in which the quotation appeared—and align it to the right.

Research is formalized curiosity. It is poking and prying with a purpose.

—Zora Neale Hurston, Dust Tracks on a Road

However,  do  provide  a  reference  list  entry  for  an  epigraph  from  an  academic  source  (e.g.,  scholarly  book  or  journal)  or  a
quotation used with permission. The parenthetical citation, including the author, date, and page number, appears after the end
punctuation  of  the  quotation  with  no  line  break.  The  example  quotation  comes  from  a  republished  work  (see  Chapter  10,
Example 29).

If life is to be sustained, hope must remain, even where confidence is wounded, trust impaired. (Erikson, 1966/2000, p. 192)

8.36 Quotations From Research Participants
Quotations  from  participants  whom  you  interviewed  as  part  of  your  research  are  treated  differently  than  quotations  from
published  works.  When  quoting  research  participants,  use  the  same  formatting  as  for  other  quotations:  Present  a  quotation  of
fewer than 40 words in quotation marks within the text (see Section 8.26),  and  present  a  quotation  of  40  words  or  more  in  a
block  quotation  (see  Section  8.27).  Because  quotations  from  research  participants  are  part  of  your  original  research,  do  not
include  them  in  the  reference  list  or  treat  them  as  personal  communications;  state  in  the  text  that  the  quotations  are  from
participants.

When quoting research participants, abide by the ethical agreements regarding confidentiality and/or anonymity between you
and  your  participants.  Take  extra  care  to  obtain  and  respect  participants’  consent  to  have  their  information  included  in  your
report.  You  may  need  to  assign  participants  a  pseudonym,  obscure  identifying  information,  or  present  information  in  the

290

aggregate (strategies for adequately disguising materials are further described in Sections 1.14 and 1.19; see also Section  1.15
regarding confidentiality in qualitative studies).

Participant “Julia,” a 32-year-old woman from California, described her experiences as a new mother as “simultaneously the best and
hardest time of my life.” Several other participants agreed, describing the beginning of parenthood as “joyful,” “lonely,” and “intense.”
Julia and the other participants completed interviews in their homes.

Agreements  regarding  confidentiality  and/or  anonymity  may  also  extend  to  other  sources  related  to  your  methodology  (e.g.,
quoting a school policy document when conducting a case study at a school). These sources would not be cited in text or listed
in  the  reference  list  because  doing  so  would  compromise  the  school’s  confidentiality  and/or  anonymity.  However,  it  may  be
possible to discuss information from these sources in the text if the material is suitably disguised.

Our  study  was  conducted  at  a  high  school  in  Atlanta,  Georgia.  School  administrators  provided  documents  containing  students’
average test scores and the percentage of students receiving free or reduced-price lunch. We used these data to contextualize the
impact of our intervention.

R EFER EN C E LIST

The reference list at the end of a paper provides the information necessary to identify and retrieve each work cited in the text.
Choose references judiciously, and include only the works that you used in the research for and preparation of your paper. APA
publications  and  other  publishers  and  institutions  using  APA  Style  generally  require  reference  lists,  not  bibliographies.  A
reference  list  cites  works  that  specifically  support  the  ideas,  claims,  and  concepts  in  a  paper;  in  contrast,  a  bibliography  cites
works for background or further reading and may include descriptive notes (e.g., an annotated bibliography; see Section 9.51).

In  this  chapter,  we  provide  guidelines  for  creating  reference  list  entries,  with  specific  sections  focusing  on  each  reference
element (author, date, title, source) and the format and order of an APA Style reference list. For information on crediting works
in  the  text  and  formatting  in-text  citations,  see  Chapter  8;  for  examples  of  specific  reference  types,  see  Chapter  10  (these
examples are cross-referenced within this chapter).

Reference Categories

9.1 Determining the Reference Category

References in the Publication Manual are organized by group, category, and type. Reference groups are textual works; data sets,
software, and tests; audiovisual media; and online media. Each group contains numbered reference categories. For example, the
textual works group contains the categories of periodicals, books and reference works, edited book chapters and reference work
entries, and dissertations and theses. The online media group contains the categories of social media and webpages and websites.
Within  each  category  are  different  reference  types.  For  example,  the  periodical  reference  category  includes  journal  articles,
magazine articles, newspaper articles, and blog posts. The social media reference category includes tweets, Facebook posts, and
Instagram photos.

To  create  a  reference  list  entry,  first  determine  the  reference  group  and  category  and  then  choose  the  appropriate  reference
type within the category and follow that example. If the work you want to cite does not match any example, choose the group,
category, and type that are most similar and adapt the format using the elements shown in the relevant template. How a work
was  accessed  or  obtained  (e.g.,  online,  in  print,  via  interlibrary  loan)  and  how  it  is  formatted  (e.g.,  print,  PDF,  DVD,  online
streaming video) have little, if any, impact on the reference list entry. See Chapter 10 for reference templates and examples.

9.2 Using the Webpages and Websites Reference Category
The term “website” can cause confusion because people use it to refer to both a reference category (see Section 10.16)  and  a
method of retrieval (i.e., online). Many types of works can be retrieved online, including articles, books, reports, and data sets,
but only some works fall into the webpages and websites reference category. Use that category only when the work does not
better fit within another category. First ask yourself, “What type of work is on this website?” Then choose the reference category
in Chapter 10  that  is  most  similar  to  the  work  you  want  to  cite  and  follow  the  most  relevant  example.  For  example,  to  cite  a
report from a government website, use the reports category (Section 10.4) and follow the format for a government report (see
Chapter 10, Examples 50–52). Likewise, to cite a webpage from a government website, use the webpages and websites category
(Section 10.16) and follow the format for a work on a website (see Chapter 10, Examples 110–114). Note that the author of a
webpage  or  website  may  be  difficult  to  determine  or  may  be  identified  through  context  (see  Section 9.7),  and  webpages  and
websites often have unknown dates of publication (see Section 9.17).

295

9.3 Online and Print References
APA Style references for online and print works are largely the same. All references generally include the author, date, title, and
source;  differences  between  online  and  print  versions  are  evident  within  the  source  element.  The  source  element  includes
information  about  where  the  work  came  from  (e.g.,  a  periodical’s  title,  a  book’s  or  report’s  publisher,  a  website’s  name).
References for works with DOIs also include the DOI in the source element, and references for most online works without DOIs
include the work’s URL (see Section 9.34 for more on when to include DOIs and URLs). However, database information and/or
database URLs are not usually included in references (see Section 9.30 for an explanation and a few exceptions). Thus, the same
template can be used to create a reference for both the print and online versions of a work. Use only one template (not multiple
templates) to create your reference entry.

Principles of Reference List Entries

9.4 Four Elements of a Reference

A reference generally has four elements: author, date, title, and source. Each element answers a question:

author: Who is responsible for this work?
date: When was this work published?
title: What is this work called?
source: Where can I retrieve this work?

Considering these four elements and answering these four questions will help you create a reference for any type of work, even
if  you  do  not  see  a  specific  example  that  matches  it.  See  the  sections  on  the  author  (Sections 9.7–9.12),  date  (Sections  9.13–
9.17), title (Sections 9.18–9.22), and source (Sections 9.23–9.37)  for  more  information  on  each  element. Figure 9.1  shows  an
example of an article title page highlighting the locations of the reference elements and showing their placement in a reference
list entry.

296

Note. This table illustrates how reference category templates change when reference elements such as the author (Section 9.12), date (Section 9.17), title
(Section 9.22), and/or source (Section 9.37) are missing. Italic formatting within the title or source varies by category and is not shown here. To create a
reference list entry, follow the template for the work’s reference category (see Section 9.1) and adjust the information as shown here.

9.5 Punctuation Within Reference List Entries
Use punctuation marks within reference list entries to group information.

Ensure that a period appears after each reference element—that is, after the author, date, title, and source. However, do not
put a period after a DOI or URL because it may interfere with link functionality.

Use  punctuation  marks  (usually  commas  or  parentheses)  between  parts  of  the  same  reference  element.  For  example,  in  a
reference  for  a  journal  article,  use  a  comma  between  each  author’s  last  name  and  initials  and  between  different  authors’
names, between the journal name and the volume number, and between the journal issue number and the page numbers. Do
not use a comma between the journal volume and issue numbers; place the issue number in parentheses instead (see Section
9.25 and Chapter 10, Example 1).

Italicize punctuation marks that appear within an italic reference element (e.g., a comma or colon within a book title). Do not
italicize punctuation between reference elements (e.g., the period after an italic book title).

9.6 Accuracy and Consistency in References
Because one purpose of listing references is to enable readers to retrieve and use the cited works, reference data must be accurate
and complete. The best way to ensure that information is accurate and complete is to check each reference carefully against the
original  publication.  Authors  are  responsible  for  all  information  in  their  reference  lists.  Accurately  prepared  references  help
establish your credibility as a careful researcher and writer.

Consistency in reference formatting allows readers to focus on the content of your reference list, discerning both the types of
works  you  consulted  and  the  important  reference  elements  (who,  when,  what,  and  where)  with  ease.  When  you  present  each

298

reference in a consistent fashion, following APA Style reference guidelines, readers do not need to spend time determining how
you organized the information. And when searching the literature yourself, you also save time and effort when reading reference
lists in the works of others. Some works contain suggested citations; these citations often contain the information necessary to
write an APA Style reference but need editing for style.

Accuracy and consistency of references are also important for ensuring that other researchers can find and access the works in
your reference list. For example, in the online version of an article, publishers use computer algorithms to link in-text citations to
reference list entries within the article, link the reference list entries to the works they cite, and compile lists of works that have
cited  each  source.  If  reference  elements  are  out  of  order  or  incomplete,  the  algorithm  may  not  recognize  them,  lowering  the
likelihood that the reference will be captured for indexing. When in doubt, place reference elements in the order of author, date,
title, and source.

Reference Elements

Author

The  following  sections  describe  the  definition,  format,  and  spelling  of  author  names  (Sections  9.7–9.9);  the  identification  of
specialized author roles, such as editor or director (Section 9.10);  and  how  to  handle  group  authors  (Section 9.11)  and  works
without an author (Section 9.12).

9.7 Definition of Author
In  a  reference,  the  author  refers  broadly  to  the  person(s)  or  group  responsible  for  a  work.  This  element  includes  not  only
author(s) of articles, books, reports, and other works but also others who played primary roles in the creation of a work, such as
the editor(s) of a book, the director of a film, the principal investigator of a grant, a podcast host, and so on.
An author may be

an individual,
multiple people,
a group (institution, government agency, organization; see Section 9.11), or
a combination of people and groups.

Sometimes the author of a work is not listed in a traditional byline but can be determined from context. For instance, the author
of an annual report is usually the organization that produced it, unless otherwise specified in the report. Thus, in the reference
list  entry  for  that  annual  report,  the  organization  would  be  listed  as  the  author.  Likewise,  in  the  reference  for  a  page  from  an
organizational  or  government  agency  website,  the  organization  or  government  agency  itself  is  considered  the  author,  unless
otherwise specified. The author of a webpage or website may also be located on an “about us” or acknowledgments page. When
you cannot determine who the author is, treat the work as having no author (see Section 9.12).

9.8 Format of the Author Element
Follow these guidelines to format the author element.

Invert all individual authors’ names, providing the surname first, followed by a comma and the initials: Author, A. A.

Use  a  comma  to  separate  an  author’s  initials  from  additional  author  names,  even  when  there  are  only  two  authors;  use  an
ampersand (&) before the final author’s name: Author, A. A., & Author, B. B.

Do not use a comma to separate two group authors: American Psychological Association & National Institutes of Health.

Use a serial comma before the ampersand (&) with three or more authors.

Provide surnames and initials for up to and including 20 authors. When there are two to 20 authors, use an ampersand before
the final author’s name: Author, A. A., Author, B. B., & Author, C. C.

When there are 21 or more authors, include the first 19 authors’ names, insert an ellipsis (but no ampersand), and then add the
final author’s name (see Chapter 10, Example 4).

Use one space between initials.

299

When given names are hyphenated, retain the hyphen and include a period after each initial but no space (e.g., Xu, A.-J., for
Ai-Jun Xu). When the second element of a hyphenated name is lowercase, treat it as a single name (e.g., Raboso, L., for Lee-
ann Raboso).

Use commas to separate initials and suffixes such as Jr. and III: Author, A. A., Jr., & Author, B. B.

If nonprimary authors are credited using the word “with” (e.g., on a book cover), include them in the reference list entry in
parentheses: Meyers, K. (with Long, W. T.). The in-text citation, however, refers to the primary author only: (Meyers, 2019).

If an author has only one name (e.g., some celebrities, some authors from Indonesia, ancient Greek and Roman authors, some
group  or  corporate  authors);  an  inseparable  multipart  name  (e.g.,  Malcolm  X,  Lady  Gaga);  an  essential  title,  in  rare  cases
(Queen Elizabeth II); or a username (or screen name) only, provide the full name or username without abbreviation in both
the reference list and the in-text citation. That is, cite Plato, Sukarno, or Lady Gaga; do not abbreviate these names to P.; S.;
or Gaga, L. In the reference list entry, add a period after the author’s name: Plato. (2017).

Do  not  include  titles,  positions,  ranks,  or  academic  achievements  with  names  in  reference  list  entries  (e.g.,  Reverend,
President,  General,  PhD,  LCSW).  A  few  reference  types  include  an  author’s  role  in  parentheses,  when  needed  (e.g.,  film
director; see Chapter 10, Example 84).

If both an author’s username and real name are known, such as for some individual and group social media authors, provide
the real name of the individual (in inverted format) or group, followed by the username in square brackets (see examples in
Section 10.15). This approach allows the reference to be grouped with any other works by that author in the reference list and
will aid readers in identifying and retrieving the cited work.

When  the  @  symbol  is  part  of  a  username,  include  that  symbol  with  the  username  in  brackets  (see Chapter  10,  Examples
103–108).

9.9 Spelling and Capitalization of Author Names
Follow these guidelines for proper spelling and capitalization of author names.

Write the author’s surname exactly as it appears in the published work, including hyphenated surnames (e.g., Santos-García)
and two-part surnames (e.g., Velasco Rodríguez; see also Chapter 10, Example 25).

If uncertain about the proper format for a name, consult other works that cite that author, bibliographic database records, or
the  author’s  website  or  curriculum  vitae  (CV)  to  determine  the  appropriate  format.  This  will  help  avoid  mistaking,  for
example,  a  two-part  surname  for  a  middle  name  and  surname  or  vice  versa.  Follow  the  most  common  presentation  if  any
ambiguity remains.

Retain the author’s preferred capitalization (e.g., hooks, b., for bell hooks) in both the reference list and the in-text citation.

9.10 Identification of Specialized Roles
People in roles other than author who contributed substantially to the creation of a work are recognized for a variety of reference
types. See the examples in Chapter 10 for instances when a specialized role is credited in the reference. In these references, the
role is placed in parentheses after the inverted surname and initials. Put a period at the end of the author element.

Use the abbreviation “(Ed.)” for one editor and the abbreviation “(Eds.)” for multiple editors. In the case of multiple editors,
include the role once.

Schulz, O. P. (Ed.).
Wong, C. T., & Music, K. (Eds.).

When a reference includes more than one type of specialized role (e.g., both writers and a director), and different individuals
played  different  roles,  identify  each  role  separately.  If  an  individual  played  multiple  roles,  combine  the  roles  using  an
ampersand (&).

Park, O. (Writer), Gunnarsson, N. (Writer), & Botha, V. N. (Director).
Lutz, T. (Writer & Director).

In  some  cases,  a  specialized  role  is  identified  later  in  the  reference  (e.g.,  an  editor  of  a  book  for  an  edited  book  chapter,  see
Chapter 10, examples in Section 10.3; a symposium chair, see Chapter 10, Example 63; a TV series producer, see Chapter 10,
Example 87).

9.11 Group Authors
Group authors may include government agencies, associations, nonprofit organizations, businesses, hospitals, task forces, and
study groups (see Chapter 10, Examples 50, 53–55, 90, and 111). A group may author a publication on its own or in combination
with individuals or other groups (see Chapter 10, Example 5).

Spell out the full name of a group author in the reference list entry, followed by a period: National Institute of Mental Health.

An abbreviation for the group author can be used in the text (see Section 8.21); however, do not include an abbreviation for a
group author in a reference list entry.

When numerous layers of government agencies are listed as the author of a work, use the most specific agency as the author
in  the  reference  (e.g.,  use  “National  Institute  of  Nursing  Research”  rather  than  “U.S.  Department  of  Health  and  Human
Services, National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Nursing Research”). The names of parent agencies not present in
the  group  author  name  appear  in  the  source  element  as  the  publisher.  This  presentation  aids  in  identifying  the  agency
responsible for the work and in creating concise in-text citations. However, if using only the most specific responsible agency
as the author would cause confusion (e.g., if you are citing both U.S. and Canadian versions of an agency and they have the
same name), then include the parent agencies in the author element to differentiate them. When there are multiple layers of
agencies, the parent body precedes the subdivision (e.g., The White House, Office of the Press Secretary). Agencies listed in
the author element are not repeated in the source element of the reference.

Sometimes it can be difficult to know whether to credit a group author or the individuals who wrote on behalf of that group;
for  example,  the  individuals  who  wrote  a  government  agency  report  may  be  credited  in  an  acknowledgments  section.  To
confirm, consult the cover or title page of the work. If the cover or title page lists only the name of the group (and no names
of individuals), treat the reference as having a group author (see Chapter 10, Examples 50 and 53–55). If the cover or title
page lists the names of individuals, treat the reference as having individual authors, and include the name of the group as part
of the source element (see Chapter 10, Examples 51–52). When a document includes a suggested reference, the author names
included in that reference indicate who should be credited (note that the format of the suggested reference may need to be
adjusted for APA Style).

9.12 No Author
A work is treated as having no author when its author is unknown or cannot reasonably be determined. In this case, move the
title of the work to the author position (followed by a period), before the date of publication (see Chapter 10, Example 49).

Generalized anxiety disorder. (2019).

If, and only if‚ the work is signed “Anonymous,” use “Anonymous” as the author.

Anonymous. (2017).

See Section 8.14 for how to format the in-text citation for a work with no author. See Section 9.49 for how to order works with
no authors in the reference list.

Date

The  following  sections  describe  the  definition  and  format  of  the  date  element  (Sections 9.13–9.14)  and  how  to  handle  online
works that are updated or reviewed (Section 9.15)  or  that  need  a  retrieval  date  (Section 9.16),  as  well  as  works  with  no  date
(Section 9.17).

9.13 Definition of Date
In a reference, the date refers to the date of publication. The date may take one of the following forms:

year only;
year, month, and day (i.e., an exact date);
year and month;
year and season; or
range of dates (e.g., range of years, range of exact dates).

301

For books, use the copyright date shown on the work’s copyright page as the date of publication in the reference, even if the
copyright date is different than the release date (e.g., 2020 would be the date in the reference for a book released in December
2019 with a copyright date of 2020). For a journal article reference, use the year of the volume, even if it is different than the
copyright year.

When citing webpages and websites (see Section 10.16), ensure that the copyright date applies to the content you are citing.
Do not use a copyright date from a webpage or website footer because this date may not indicate when the content on the site
was published. If a note indicates the “last updated” date of the page, use that date if it applies to the content you are citing (see
Section 9.15). If no separate date of publication is indicated for the work on the webpage, treat the work as having no date (see
Section 9.17).

9.14 Format of the Date Element
Follow the date format and examples shown in each reference category (see Chapter 10). Use more specific dates for works that
are published more frequently (e.g., year, month, and day for newspaper articles and blog posts). Most references include only
the year of publication.

Enclose the date of publication in parentheses, followed by a period: (2020).

For  works  from  a  reference  category  that  includes  the  month,  day,  and/or  season  along  with  the  year,  put  the  year  first,
followed by a comma, and then the month and date or season:

(2020, August 26).
(2020, Spring/Summer).

For unpublished, informally published, or in-progress works, provide the year the work was produced (see Section 10.8). Do
not use “in progress” or “submitted for publication” in the date element of a reference.

If a work has been accepted for publication but is not yet published, use the term “in press” instead of a year (see Chapter 10,
Example 8). Do not provide a date in the reference until the work has been published.

If a work is an advance online publication, use the year of the advance online publication in the reference (see Chapter 10,
Example 7).

If a work includes both an advance online publication date and a final publication date, use the final publication date in the
reference.

When the date of original publication is approximate, use the abbreviation “ca.” (which stands for “circa”; see Chapter 10,
Example 36).

9.15 Updated or Reviewed Online Works
Some online works note when a work was last updated. If this date is available and is clearly attributable to the specific content
you are citing rather than the overall website, use the updated date in the reference (see Chapter 10, Example 14, for a source
retrieved from the UpToDate database).

Do not include a date of last review in a reference because content that has been reviewed has not necessarily been changed. If

a date of last review is noted on a work, ignore it for the purposes of the reference.

9.16 Retrieval Dates
Although  most  online  sources  can  be  updated,  some  are  inherently  designed  to  change  (e.g.,  dictionary  entry,  Twitter  profile,
Facebook page; see Chapter 10, Examples 33, 47, 104, and 106) or reflect information that changes over time (e.g., UpToDate
article, map generated by Google Maps, work on a website that updates frequently; see Chapter 10, Examples 14, 100, and 113).
Provide a retrieval date in the source element when citing an unarchived (i.e., not stable) work that is likely or meant to change.
Including this date indicates to readers that the version of the work they retrieve may be different from the version you used.

For works that may change over time but have archived versions (e.g., Cochrane reviews or Wikipedia articles),  a  retrieval
date is not needed because the archived version of the page is stable and can be retrieved (e.g., via a permalink; see Chapter 10,
Examples 13 and 49). The majority of references do not include retrieval dates; the types that might are noted in the applicable
reference examples in Chapter 10. The retrieval date, when needed, appears before the URL.

9.17 No Date
Sometimes  the  publication  date  of  a  work  is  unknown  or  cannot  be  determined.  For  works  with  no  date,  write  “n.d.”  (which
stands for “no date”) in parentheses. Put a period after the “n” and after the “d” with no space between the letters.

Gagnon, R. (n.d.).

The date also appears as “n.d.” in the corresponding in-text citation.

(Gagnon, n.d.) or Gagnon (n.d.)

Title

The following sections describe the definition and format of the title element (Sections 9.18–9.19) and how to handle series and
multivolume  works  (Section 9.20),  use  bracketed  descriptions  (Section  9.21),  and  account  for  works  without  a  title  (Section
9.22).

9.18 Definition of Title
In a reference, the title refers to the title of the work being cited. Titles fall into two broad categories: works that stand alone
(e.g.,  whole  books,  reports,  gray  literature,  dissertations  and  theses,  informally  published  works,  data  sets,  videos,  films,  TV
series, podcasts, social media, and works on websites) and works that are part of a greater whole (e.g., periodical articles, edited
book chapters, and TV and podcast episodes). When a work stands alone (e.g., a report), the title of that work appears in the title
element of the reference. When a work is part of a greater whole (e.g., a journal article or edited book chapter), the title of the
article  or  chapter  appears  in  the  title  element  of  the  reference  and  the  title  of  the  greater  whole  (the  journal  or  edited  book)
appears in the source element (see Sections 9.25 and 9.28, respectively).

9.19 Format of the Title Element
Follow these guidelines to format the title element.

For  works  that  are  part  of  a  greater  whole  (e.g.,  journal  articles,  edited  book  chapters),  do  not  italicize  the  title  or  use
quotation marks, and capitalize it using sentence case (see Section 6.17).

The virtue gap in humor: Exploring benevolent and corrective humor.

For works that stand alone (e.g., books, reports, webpages and websites), italicize the title, and capitalize it using sentence
case (see Section 6.17).

Adoption-specific therapy: A guide to helping adopted children and their families thrive.

For book and report references, enclose in parentheses after the title any additional information given in the publication for its
identification  and  retrieval  (e.g.,  edition,  report  number,  volume  number).  Do  not  add  a  period  between  the  title  and  the
parenthetical  information,  and  do  not  italicize  the  parenthetical  information.  If  both  edition  and  volume  information  are
included, separate these elements with a comma, placing the edition number first.

Nursing: A concept-based approach to learning (2nd ed., Vol. 1).

If  a  numbered  volume  has  its  own  title,  the  volume  number  and  title  are  included  as  part  of  the  main  title,  rather  than  in
parentheses (see Chapter 10, Examples 30 and 45).

Finish the title element with a period. However, if the title ends with a question mark or exclamation point, that punctuation
mark replaces the period.

See Section 6.17 for how to format titles that appear in the text.

9.20 Series and Multivolume Works
For  a  book  that  is  part  of  a  multivolume  work,  such  as  a  handbook  comprising  three  volumes,  include  the  series  title  in  the
reference list entry. For examples of titled and untitled volumes, see Chapter 10, Example 30.

When a book is part of a series of conceptually related but separate works (e.g., popular book series such as Harry Potter or
the Chronicles of Narnia), include only the book title, not the series title, in the reference. Depending on the publisher and the

303

series, the series name may be either prominent or hard to find; therefore, we recommend omitting it to avoid confusion (see
Chapter 10, Example 31).

9.21 Bracketed Descriptions
To help identify works outside the peer-reviewed academic literature (i.e., works other than articles, books, reports, etc.), provide
a description of the work in square brackets after the title and before the period. The description aids readers in identifying and
retrieving  the  work.  Examples  of  works  that  include  bracketed  descriptions  are  some  audiobooks,  gray  literature  (e.g.,  press
releases),  audiovisual  works  (e.g.,  films,  YouTube  videos,  photographs),  software  and  mobile  apps,  data  sets,  manuscripts  in
preparation,  and  dissertations  and  theses.  Bracketed  descriptions  are  also  used  in  social  media  references  to  indicate  attached
links or images. Capitalize the first letter of the description, but do not italicize the description.

Comprehensive meta-analysis (Version 3.3.070) [Computer software].

The examples in Chapter 10 include bracketed descriptions where they are needed. When in doubt, include a description. Back-
to-back brackets (e.g., when a translated title is followed by a description) are acceptable in references. Consistency of wording
is helpful (see Section 9.6), but you may alter the wording shown in the examples to best convey the information readers need.
Use succinct descriptions, as shown in the examples in Chapter 10.

9.22 No Title
For works without a title, include a description of the work in square brackets instead.

When possible, specify the medium in the description of the untitled work (e.g., a map) rather than including two bracketed
descriptions.

[Map showing the population density of the United States as of the year 2010].

For  untitled  comments  on  periodical  articles,  include  up  to  the  first  20  words  of  the  comment  or  post  in  addition  to  a
description (see Chapter 10, Example 18).

For untitled social media posts, include up to the first 20 words of the comment or post (in italic) in addition to a bracketed
description (see Chapter 10, Examples 103, 105, 107, and 108).

Source

The  following  sections  describe  the  definition  and  format  of  the  source  element  (Sections  9.23–9.24).  Then  guidelines  for
handling specific kinds of sources are presented, including periodicals (Sections 9.25–9.27); edited book chapters and reference
work entries (Section 9.28); publishers (Section 9.29); databases and archives (Section 9.30); works with specific locations, such
as conferences (Section 9.31); social media (Section 9.32); and webpages and websites (Section 9.33). Works that have a DOI or
URL (Sections 9.34–9.36) and works without a source (Section 9.37) are also addressed.

9.23 Definition of Source
In a reference, the source indicates where readers can retrieve the cited work. As with titles (see Section 9.18), sources fall into
two broad categories: works that are part of a greater whole and works that stand alone.

The source for a work that is part of a greater whole (e.g., journal article, edited book chapter) is that greater whole (i.e., the
journal [see Section 9.25] or edited book [see Section 9.28]), plus any applicable DOI or URL (see Sections 9.34–9.36).

The  source  for  a  work  that  stands  alone  (e.g.,  whole  book,  report,  dissertation,  thesis,  film,  TV  series,  podcast,  data  set,
informally published work, social media, webpage) is the publisher of the work (see Section 9.29), database or archive (see
Section  9.30),  social  media  site  (see  Section  9.32),  or  website  (see  Section  9.33),  plus  any  applicable  DOI  or  URL  (see
Sections 9.34–9.36).

Works  associated  with  a  specific  location  (e.g.,  conference  presentations)  include  location  information  in  the  source  (see
Section 9.31) and, depending on the work, may also include a DOI or URL (see Sections 9.34–9.36).

General guidelines on the source element are provided in the following sections; see Chapter 10 for templates and examples of
source components to include for each reference category.

304

9.24 Format of the Source Element
The source element of a reference has one or two parts, depending on the reference category. For example, the source for a print
book without a DOI has one part: the book publisher. However, the source for a journal article with a DOI has two parts: the
periodical information (the journal title, volume number, issue number, and page range or article number) and the DOI.

Information in the source may be omitted from the reference to avoid repetition. Namely, when the author and publisher or
site name of a book, report, webpage, or website are the same, the publisher or site name is omitted from the source element. See
Sections 9.25 to 9.33 for guidance on formatting the source for particular reference categories.

9.25 Periodical Sources
When  a  periodical  (i.e.,  journal,  magazine,  newspaper,  newsletter,  or  blog)  is  the  source,  provide  the  periodical  title,  volume
number, issue number, and page range or article number (see Chapter 10, Examples 1–6, 9–12, 15, and 16).

Psychology of Popular Media Culture, 5(2), 101–118.

Capitalize the title of a periodical using title case (see Section 6.17), italicize it, and place a comma (not italicized) after it.

Reproduce periodical titles as shown on the cited work. If the periodical’s official title includes an abbreviation, reproduce
that  abbreviated  title  in  the  reference  (e.g.,  PLOS  ONE,  JAMA  Pediatrics).  However,  do  not  abbreviate  periodical  titles
yourself  (e.g.,  do  not  abbreviate  The  New  England  Journal  of  Medicine  to  N  Engl  J  Med).  Likewise,  do  not  reproduce
abbreviated titles from other reference lists or databases (e.g., if you find an article from JAMA Pediatrics in PubMed Central,
use JAMA Pediatrics in the reference, not PubMed Central’s abbreviation of JAMA Pediatr).

Italicize the volume number.

Include the issue number for all periodicals that have issue numbers. Place the issue number immediately after the volume
number  (with  no  space  in  between),  and  enclose  the  issue  number  in  parentheses.  Place  a  comma  after  the  closing
parenthesis. Do not italicize the issue number, the parentheses, or the comma after the issue number.

Write the page range (or article number; see Section 9.27) after a comma and the issue number, without italics. Separate page
numbers in a range by an en dash, followed by a period. Separate discontinuous page numbers by commas.

39–47, 50.

Finish  the  periodical  information  part  of  the  source  element  with  a  period,  followed  by  a  DOI  or  URL  as  applicable  (see
Sections 9.34–9.36).

9.26 Online Periodicals With Missing Information
Many  online  periodicals  (e.g.,  newspapers,  blogs)  publish  articles  without  volume,  issue,  and/or  page  numbers  or  article
numbers. Omit these elements from the reference if they are not present in the cited work. For example, for an online newspaper
article or blog post, only the title of the periodical (i.e., of the newspaper or blog) may be present (see Chapter 10, Examples 16,
17, and 68).

The New York Times.

9.27 Article Numbers
For articles with article numbers (which may be called “eLocators” or another term), write the word “Article” (capitalized) and
then provide the article number instead of the page range (see Chapter 10, Example 6).

PLOS ONE, 11(7), Article e0158474.

If an article with an article number also has numbered pages (such as in a PDF), those page numbers may be used for in-text
citations (see Sections 8.23 and 8.25) but do not appear in the reference list entry.

9.28 Edited Book Chapter and Reference Work Entry Sources
For edited book chapters and entries in reference works (e.g., dictionary definitions), the source is the edited book or the whole
reference work (see Chapter 10, Examples 38–48).

305

For works with editors, in the source element of the reference, write the word “In” followed by the initials and surnames (not
inverted) of the editors. If there is one editor, follow that editor’s name with “(Ed.).” If there are two or more editors, follow
the final editor’s name with “(Eds.).” Then add a comma, the title of the whole book or reference work in italic sentence case
(see  Section  6.17),  the  page  (abbreviated  “p.”)  or  page  range  (abbreviated  “pp.”)  of  the  chapter  or  entry  in  parentheses
without italics, and a period. Then provide the name of the publisher (see Section 9.29).

In E. E. Editor (Ed.), Title of book (pp. xx–xx). Publisher.

If the edited book or reference work has edition or volume information in addition to page numbers, include them in the same
parentheses in the following order: edition, volume number, and page numbers (separated by commas).

Title of book (2nd ed., Vol. 3, pp. xx–xx).

If a numbered book volume has its own title, include the volume number and title after the main title of the book. A colon
follows the main title, “Volume” is abbreviated “Vol.,” and a period follows the volume number, after which the volume title
appears.

Main title of book: Vol. 2. Volume title (2nd ed., pp. xx–xx).

For a reference work (e.g., Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary, APA Dictionary of Psychology, mobile app reference work) with a
group author, do not repeat the group author name in the source element when the publisher is the same as the author. Simply
write “In” and the name of the reference work in italics (see Chapter 10, Examples 47 and 80).

TV  episodes,  podcast  episodes,  and  songs  from  albums  follow  the  same  pattern  as  edited  book  chapters  and  entries  from
reference works (see Chapter 10, Examples 87, 92, and 94).

Finish the source element with a period, followed by a DOI or URL as applicable (see Section 9.34).

9.29 Publisher Sources
The name of the publisher is provided in the source element for a number of reference categories, including whole books, edited
book chapters, reports, computer software and mobile apps, and data sets. Do not include the publisher location in the reference.
Online search makes a work easily discoverable without it, and it may be unclear what location to provide for publishers with
offices worldwide or online-only publishers that do not readily disclose their location.

Write  the  publisher  name  as  shown  on  the  work,  followed  by  a  period.  Do  not  abbreviate  the  publisher  name  unless  it  is
shown in abbreviated form on the work.

Note: Some publishers may prefer to abbreviate publisher names (e.g., “John Wiley & Sons” to “Wiley”) to save space in reference
list entries; this is acceptable as part of a house style. If you intend to publish your work, consult the policies of the publisher to
determine whether to follow this practice.

The format of publisher names may vary over time and across works (e.g., SAGE Publishing vs. Sage Publications); use the
spelling  and  capitalization  of  the  publisher  name  as  shown  on  the  work  you  used.  It  is  not  necessary  to  standardize  the
presentation of a publisher’s name if it appears in multiple entries in a reference list.

If the work is published by an imprint or division, use the imprint or division as the publisher (e.g., Magination Press, which
is an imprint of the American Psychological Association, would be used as the publisher).

Do not include designations of business structure (e.g., Inc., Ltd., LLC) in the publisher name.

If two or more publishers are listed on the copyright page, include all of them in the order shown on the work, separated by
semicolons (see Chapter 10, Example 24).

Guilford Press; Basic Books.

When the author is the same as the publisher (such as with an annual report written and published by the same company, a
reference book published by a professional organization, or a work from an organizational website), omit the publisher from
the reference to avoid repetition (see Chapter 10, Examples 32, 50, 54, and 55).

306

Finish the publisher information component of the source element with a period, followed by a DOI or URL as applicable
(see Sections 9.34–9.36).

9.30 Database and Archive Sources
Database and archive information is seldom needed in reference list entries. The purpose of a reference list entry is to provide
readers with the details they will need to perform a search themselves if necessary, not to replicate the path the author of the
work personally used. Most periodical and book content is available through a variety of databases or platforms, and different
readers will have different methods or points of access. Additionally, URLs from databases or library-provided services usually
require a login and/or are session specific, meaning they will not be accessible to most readers and are not suitable to include in
a reference list.

Provide database or other online archive information in a reference only when it is necessary for readers to retrieve the cited
work from that exact database or archive.

Provide the name of the database or archive when it publishes original, proprietary works available only in that database or
archive (e.g., Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews or UpToDate; see Chapter 10, Examples 13–14). References for
these works are similar to journal article references; the name of the database or archive is written in italic title case in the
source element, the same as a periodical title.
Provide the name of the database or archive for works of limited circulation, such as
dissertations and theses published in ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global,
works in a university archive,
manuscripts posted in a preprint archive like PsyArXiv (see Chapter 10, Example 73),
works posted in an institutional or government repository, and
monographs published in ERIC or primary sources published in JSTOR (see Chapter 10, Example 74).

These references are similar to report references; the name of the database or archive is provided in the source element (in
title case without italics), the same as a publisher name.

Do not include database information for works obtained from most academic research databases or platforms because works
in  these  resources  are  widely  available.  Examples  of  academic  research  databases  and  platforms  include  APA  PsycNET,
PsycINFO,  Academic  Search  Complete,  CINAHL,  Ebook  Central,  EBSCOhost,  Google  Scholar,  JSTOR  (excluding  its
primary  sources  collection  because  these  are  works  of  limited  distribution),  MEDLINE,  Nexis  Uni,  Ovid,  ProQuest
(excluding its dissertations and theses databases, because dissertations and theses are works of limited circulation), PubMed
Central (excluding authors’ final peer-reviewed manuscripts because these are works of limited circulation), ScienceDirect,
Scopus, and Web of Science. When citing a work from one of these databases or platforms, do not include the database or
platform name in the reference list entry unless the work falls under one of the exceptions.

If you are in doubt as to whether to include database information in a reference, refer to the template for the reference type in
question (see Chapter 10).

Finish the database or archive component of the source element with a period, followed by a DOI or URL as applicable (see
Sections 9.34–9.36).

9.31 Works With Specific Locations
For works associated with a specific location, such as conference presentations (see Chapter 10, Examples 60–63; for more, see
the Source Variations list at the beginning of Chapter 10), include the location in the source element of the reference to help with
retrieval. Provide the city; state, province, or territory as applicable; and country. Use the two-letter postal code abbreviations for
U.S. states and the analogous abbreviations (if any) for states, provinces, or territories in other countries.

New York, NY, United States
Vancouver, BC, Canada
Sydney, NSW, Australia

9.32 Social Media Sources

Istanbul, Turkey
Lima, Peru
London, England

307

Use  social  media  as  a  source  only  when  the  content  was  originally  published  there  (e.g.,  an  original  Instagram  post).  If  you
found a link to content via social media (e.g., a pin on Pinterest), cite the content you used directly and do not mention that you
originally discovered it through a link on social media, except as necessary in describing your research methodology.

When social media is the source (e.g., Instagram photo, tweet, Facebook post), provide the social media site name (in title
case without italics) in the source element (see Section 6.17): Twitter.

Include a period after the social media site name, followed by the URL (see Sections 9.34–9.36).

9.33 Website Sources
When a website is the source for a webpage (see Section 9.2), follow these guidelines to format the website source.

Provide the website name (in title case without italics) in the source element (see Section 6.17): BBC News.

Include a period after the website name, followed by the URL (see Sections 9.34–9.36).

When the author of the work is the same as the website name, omit the site name from the source element to avoid repetition
(see Chapter 10, Example 111). In this case, the source element will consist of only the URL of the work.

9.34 When to Include DOIs and URLs
The DOI or URL is the final component of the reference list entry. Because so much scholarship is available and/or retrieved
online, most reference list entries end with either a DOI or a URL. A DOI, or digital object identifier, is a unique alphanumeric
string that identifies content and provides a persistent link to its location on the internet. It is typically located on the first page of
an  article  near  the  copyright  notice,  and  it  starts  with  “https://doi.org/”  or  “http://dx.doi.org”  or  “DOI:”  and  is  followed  by  a
string of letters and numbers. DOIs begin with the number 10 and contain a prefix and a suffix separated by a slash. The prefix is
a unique number of four or more digits assigned to the organization by the International DOI Foundation (https://www.doi.org/);
the  suffix  is  assigned  by  the  publisher  and  was  designed  to  be  flexible  with  publisher  identification  standards.  The  publisher
assigns a DOI to a work when it is published, and many publishers have retroactively assigned DOIs to works published prior to
the implementation of the DOI system in 2000. Registration agencies, such as Crossref, use DOIs to provide reference-linking
services  to  the  scientific  publishing  sector.  DOIs  can  also  be  found  in  database  records  and  the  reference  lists  of  published
works. A URL, or uniform resource locator, specifies the location of digital information on the internet and can be found in the
address bar of your internet browser.

URLs in references should link directly to the cited work when possible. For example, when citing a comment on an online
newspaper article, the URL in the reference should link to the comment itself rather than to the article or the newspaper’s home
page (direct links to comments may be available if you click the comment’s time stamp and copy the URL for the comment that
appears in your browser).

Follow these guidelines for including DOIs and URLs in references:

Include a DOI for all works that have a DOI, regardless of whether you used the online version or the print version.

If a print work does not have a DOI, do not include any DOI or URL in the reference.

If an online work has both a DOI and a URL, include only the DOI.

If an online work has a URL but no DOI, include the URL in the reference as follows:

For works without DOIs from websites (not including databases), provide a URL in the reference (as long as the URL will
work for readers).
For  works  without  DOIs  from  most  academic  research  databases,  do  not  include  a  URL  or  database  information  in  the
reference because these works are widely available (see Section 9.30). The reference should be the same as the reference
for a print version of the work.
For  works  from  databases  that  publish  works  of  limited  circulation  (such  as  the  ERIC  database)  or  original,  proprietary
material available only in that database (such as the UpToDate database), include the name of the database or archive and
the URL of the work (see Section 9.30). If the URL requires a login or is session specific, meaning it will not resolve for
readers, provide the URL of the database or archive home page or login page instead of the URL for the work.
If the URL is no longer working or no longer provides readers access to the content you intend to cite, follow the guidance
for works with no source (see Section 9.37).

308

Other alphanumeric identifiers such as the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) and the International Standard Serial
Number (ISSN) are not included in APA Style references.

9.35 Format of DOIs and URLs

Follow these guidelines to format DOIs and URLs.

Present  both  DOIs  and  URLs  as  hyperlinks  (i.e.,  beginning  with  “http://”  or  “https://”).  Because  a  hyperlink  leads  readers
directly to the content, it is not necessary to include the words “Retrieved from” or “Accessed from” before a DOI or URL.

It is acceptable to use either the default display settings for hyperlinks in your word-processing program (e.g., usually blue
font, underlined) or plain text that is not underlined.

Links should be live if the work is to be published or read online.

Follow the current recommendations of the International DOI Foundation to format DOIs in the reference list, which as of
this publication is as follows:

https://doi.org/xxxxx

Here, “https://doi.org/” is a way of presenting a DOI as a link, and “xxxxx” refers to the DOI number. The preferred format
of the DOI has changed over time; although older works use previous formats (e.g., “http://dx.doi.org/” or “doi:” or “DOI:”
before  the  DOI  number),  in  your  reference  list,  standardize  DOIs  into  the  current  preferred  format  for  all  entries.  For
example, use https://doi.org/10.1037/a0040251 in your reference even though that article, published in 2016, presented the
number in an older format.

Why use the new DOI format? The current DOI format presents the DOI as a direct link to the work rather than as an unlinked
number or a link through a proxy server. It simplifies and standardizes retrieval.

See Chapter 10, Sections 10.1 to 10.3, 10.7, and 10.9, for examples of references that include DOIs.

Copy and paste the DOI or URL from your web browser directly into your reference list to avoid transcription errors. Do not
change  the  capitalization  or  punctuation  of  the  DOI  or  URL.  Do  not  add  line  breaks  manually  to  the  hyperlink;  it  is
acceptable if your word-processing program automatically adds a break or moves the hyperlink to its own line. If your work
is published, the typesetter may break hyperlinks after punctuation to improve page flow.

Do not add a period after the DOI or URL because it may interfere with link functionality.

9.36 DOI or URL Shorteners
When  a  DOI  or  URL  is  long  or  complex,  you  may  use  shortDOIs  or  shortened  URLs  if  desired.  Use  the  shortDOI  service
provided  by  the  International  DOI  Foundation  (http://shortdoi.org/)  to  create  shortDOIs.  A  work  can  have  only  one  DOI  and
only one shortDOI; the shortDOI service will either produce a new shortDOI for a work that has never had one or retrieve an
existing shortDOI.

Some websites provide their own branded shortened URLs, and independent URL shortening services are available as well.
Any shortened URL is acceptable in a reference as long as you check the link to ensure that it takes you to the correct location.
See Examples 4 and 18 in Chapter 10 for a shortDOI and a shortened URL, respectively, used in a reference.

9.37 No Source
A reference without a recoverable source cannot be included in the reference list because readers cannot retrieve the work. In
most cases, nonrecoverable sources such as personal emails, classroom lectures, and intranet sources should be cited only in the
text as personal communications (see Section 8.9).

Online works that are no longer accessible are considered nonrecoverable sources. Before submitting a paper, test the URLs in
your reference list to ensure that they work and update them as necessary. Do not include broken URLs in your paper. If the
content  you  cited  is  no  longer  available  online,  search  for  an  archived  version  of  the  page  on  the  Internet  Archive
(https://archive.org/) and use the archived URL. If no archived version of the URL is available, delete the reference list entry and
substitute another reference if possible.

309

Reference Variations

Some works may be in another language or translated, reprinted, reissued, or republished. For each of these reference variations,
additional information about the work and/or its publication history is included in the reference list entry.

9.38 Works in Another Language
Multilingual authors may cite works published in a language other than the language in which they are writing. For example, an
author who understands both English and Spanish may write a paper in English and cite both English and Spanish works. From
the perspective of readers of that paper, the language in which the paper is written (in this example, English) is considered the
main language and any other language in the paper (in this example, Spanish) is considered “another language.”

To cite a work that is in another language, provide the author, date, title, and source of the work in the original language as
well as a translation of the title in square brackets after the title and before the period (see Chapter 10, Examples 9, 27, and 85).
In the case of a work that is part of a greater whole (e.g., an edited book chapter), translate only the title of the work being cited
(e.g., the chapter title; see Chapter 10, Example 41); it is not necessary to translate the title of the greater whole (e.g., the book
title). So, for example, if you are writing in English and cite a Spanish work, provide the author, date, title, and source in the
original  Spanish  in  the  reference  list,  and  also  provide  the  title  of  the  work  translated  into  English  in  square  brackets.  The
translation  does  not  have  to  be  literal;  the  purpose  of  including  the  translation  is  to  give  readers  a  sense  of  what  the  work  is
about.  Use  appropriate  grammar  and  punctuation  in  the  translated  title.  Authors  writing  in  any  language  can  implement  these
guidelines.

If  the  other  language  uses  a  different  alphabet  from  the  one  you  are  writing  in,  transliterate  the  alphabet  into  the  Roman
alphabet.  For  example,  Dutch,  English,  French,  German,  Spanish,  and  Swahili  use  the  Roman  alphabet,  whereas  Amharic,
Arabic, Farsi, Hebrew, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, and Russian use other alphabets. If transliteration is not possible or
advisable,  it  is  acceptable  to  reproduce  the  original  alphabet  in  the  paper.  In  that  case,  use  your  judgment  about  where  to
alphabetize the reference list entry—let the order of reference list entries found in other published articles serve as a guide—or
place the entry at the end of the list. In any case, provide a translation of the title of the work in square brackets after the title,
before the period (see Chapter 10, Example 27).

9.39 Translated Works
Cite translated works in the language in which the translation was published. For example, if a French article was translated into
English and you read the English translation, your reference list entry should be in English. Credit the translator in the reference
for a translated work (see Chapter 10, Examples 10, 28, 29, 35, 36, and 42). For all translated works, also provide the year the
work was originally published in its original language at the end of the reference in parentheses in the following format:

(Original work published 1955)

See Section 8.15 for how to write the in-text citation for a translated work.

9.40 Reprinted Works
A reprinted work is one that has been published in two places and is available in both (e.g., a journal article that was reprinted as
an  edited  book  chapter).  The  reference  list  entry  includes  information  about  both  publications  to  avoid  the  appearance  of
duplicate publication (see Section 1.16).  In  the  reference  list  entry  for  a  reprinted  work,  first  provide  the  information  for  the
work that you read. Then, in parentheses, provide information about the original publication. In Chapter 10, see Example 11 for
a  journal  article  reprinted  in  another  journal,  Example  43  for  a  journal  article  reprinted  as  a  chapter  in  an  edited  book,  and
Example 44 for a chapter in an edited book reprinted in another book. See Section 8.15 for how to write the in-text citation for a
reprinted work.

9.41 Republished or Reissued Works
A republished work is one that went out of print (i.e., was no longer available) and then was published again; this is common for
older  works.  The  term  “reissued”  is  used  in  the  music  industry  to  refer  to  the  same  concept.  When  an  anthology  consists  of
works that were published previously (as opposed to new works), the works in that anthology are treated as being republished
rather than reprinted. To cite a republished or reissued work (e.g., a work republished in an anthology), provide the details of the

310

new publication that you used, followed by the year the work was originally published in parentheses at the end of the reference
in the following format:

(Original work published 1922)

In  Chapter  10,  see  Example  10  for  an  example  of  a  republished  journal  article;  Examples  28,  29,  and  42  for  examples  of
republished books; and Example 46 for an example of a work republished in an anthology. See Section 8.15 for how to write the
in-text citation for a republished work.

9.42 Religious and Classical Works
Religious  works  (e.g.,  Bible,  Qur’an,  Torah,  Bhagavad  Gita),  classical  works  (e.g.,  ancient  Greek  and  Roman  works),  and
classical literature (e.g., by Shakespeare) are all cited like books (see Section 10.2).

Religious  works  (see  Chapter  10,  Example  35)  are  usually  treated  as  having  no  author  (see  Section  9.12).  However,  an
annotated version of a religious work would be treated as having an editor.

The  year  of  original  publication  of  a  religious  work  may  be  unknown  or  in  dispute  and  is  not  included  in  the  reference  in
those cases. However, versions of religious works such as the Bible may be republished; these republished dates are included
in the reference (see Section 9.41 and Chapter 10, Example 35).

For translated religious and classical works, include the translator’s name in the reference (see Section 9.39 and Chapter 10,
Example 28).

Classical works (e.g., ancient Greek and Roman works; see Chapter 10, Example 36) and works of classical literature (e.g.,
by Shakespeare; see Chapter 10, Example 37) are treated as republished works (see Section 9.41).

When the date of original publication for a classical work is ancient, use the abbreviation “B.C.E.” (which stands for “before
the  common  era”),  and  if  that  date  is  approximate,  use  the  abbreviation  “ca.”  (which  stands  for  “circa”;  see  Chapter  10,
Example 36). Dates in the common era do not need to be noted as “C.E.” (“common era”) or “A.D.” (“anno Domini”).

If a religious or classical work has canonically numbered parts common across editions (e.g., books, chapters, verses, lines,
cantos), use these numbers instead of page numbers when referring to a specific part of the work (see Section 8.13) or directly
quoting the work (see Section 8.28).

See Section 8.28 for how to format the in-text citation for these works.

Reference List Format and Order

9.43 Format of the Reference List

The following guidelines will help you properly format your reference list in APA Style:

Begin the reference list on a new page after the text.

Place the section label “References” in bold at the top of the page, centered.

Order the reference list entries alphabetically by author, as described in Sections 9.44 to 9.48.

Double-space the entire reference list (both within and between entries).

Apply  a  hanging  indent  of  0.5  in.  to  each  reference  list  entry,  meaning  that  the  first  line  of  the  reference  is  flush  left  and
subsequent  lines  are  indented  0.5  in.  from  the  left  margin.  Use  the  paragraph-formatting  function  of  your  word-processing
program to apply the hanging indent.

9.44 Order of Works in the Reference List
Works are listed in alphabetical order in the reference list by the first word of the reference list entry, according to the following
principles:

Arrange entries in alphabetical order by the surname of the first author followed by the initials of the author’s given name(s).
In  APA  Style  for  alphabetizing  names,  “nothing  precedes  something”:  Loft,  V.  H.  precedes  Loftus,  E.  F.,  even  though  “u”
precedes “v” in the alphabet.

311

When alphabetizing names, disregard any spaces or punctuation marks (e.g., apostrophes, hyphens) in two-word surnames.
Also disregard anything in parentheses (e.g., roles like “Eds.”) or square brackets (e.g., usernames).

Alphabetize  entries  by  authors  who  have  the  same  given  name  and  surname  with  suffixes  indicating  birth  order
chronologically, oldest first.

See Figure 9.2  for  examples  of  how  to  order  works  in  the  reference  list.  For  further  examples,  review  the  reference  lists  of
published articles or the sample papers on the APA Style website (https://apastyle.apa.org).

Figure 9.2 Examples of the Order of Works in a Reference List

Full Description.

9.45 Order of Surname and Given Name
Naming practices for the order of given name and surname vary by culture; in some cultures, the given name appears before the
surname,  whereas  in  others,  the  surname  appears  first.  If  you  are  uncertain  of  which  name  order  you  are  reading,  check  the
author’s preferred form (e.g., by visiting their website or their institution’s website or by reading their bio or CV), or consult the
author’s previous publications to see how their name was presented there. For example, an author may publish as “Zhang Yi-
Chen” in China but as “Yi-Chen Zhang” in the United States; in either case, according to APA Style, this author would be listed
as “Zhang, Y.-C.,” in the reference list. See Section 9.9 for more.

9.46 Order of Multiple Works by the Same First Author
When ordering multiple works by the same first author in the reference list, include the author’s name in every entry.

312

One-author entries should be arranged by year of publication, the earliest first. References with no date precede references
with dates, and in-press references are listed last.

Patel, S. N. (n.d.).
Patel, S. N. (2016).
Patel, S. N. (2020a).
Patel, S. N. (2020b, April).
Patel, S. N. (in press).

One-author entries should precede multiple-author entries beginning with the same first author, even if the multiple-author
work was published earlier.

Davison, T. E. (2019).
Davison, T. E., & McCabe, M. P. (2015).

Multiple-author entries in which all authors appear in the same order should be arranged by the year of publication (the same
as one-author entries).

Costa, P. T., Jr., & McCrae, R. R. (2013).
Costa, P. T., Jr., & McCrae, R. R. (2014).

Multiple-author entries with the same first author and different subsequent authors should be arranged alphabetically by the
surname of the second author or, if the second author is the same, the surname of the third author, and so forth.

Jacobson, T. E., Duncan, B., & Young, S. E. (2019).
Jacobson, T. E., & Raymond, K. M. (2017).
Pfeiffer, S. J., Chu, W.-W., & Park, S. H. (2018).
Pfeiffer, S. J., Chu, W.-W., & Wall, T. L. (2018).

9.47 Order of Works With the Same Author and Same Date
Ambiguity can arise when multiple works cited in a paper have the same author and date (i.e., the same author[s] in the same
order and the same year of publication) because the same in-text citation would then correspond to multiple reference list entries.
To differentiate references with the same author and year, put a lowercase letter after the year in both the in-text citation and the
reference list entry.

The letter format for references with years is “2020a,” “2020b.”
The letter format for references with no date is “n.d.-a,” “n.d.-b.”
The letter format for in-press references is in “in press-a,” “in press-b.”

Assigning  the  letters  is  a  two-step  process.  First,  compare  the  dates.  References  with  only  a  year  precede  those  with  more
specific dates, and specific dates are placed in chronological order.

Azikiwe, H., & Bello, A. (2020a).
Azikiwe, H., & Bello, A. (2020b, March 26).
Azikiwe, H., & Bello, A. (2020c, April 2).

Second, if the references have identical dates, alphabetize the references by title (disregarding the words “A,” “An,” and “The”
at the beginning of a reference title). The following are examples of references in the proper order.

Judge,  T.  A.,  &  Kammeyer-Mueller,  J.  D.  (2012a).  General  and  specific  measures  in  organizational  behavior  research:
Considerations,  examples,  and  recommendations  for  researchers.  Journal  of  Organizational  Behavior,  33(2),  161–174.
https://doi.org/10.1002/job.764

Judge, T. A., & Kammeyer-Mueller, J. D. (2012b). On the value of aiming high: The causes and consequences of ambition. Journal of

Applied Psychology, 97(4), 758–775. https://doi.org/10.1037/a0028084

However,  if  references  with  the  same  author  and  date  are  identified  as  articles  in  a  series  (e.g.,  Part  1  and  Part  2),  order  the
references in the series order, regardless of the titles’ alphabetical order.

For citing works with the same author and date in text, see Section 8.19.

9.48 Order of Works by First Authors With the Same Surname
Arrange works by first authors with the same surname and different initials alphabetically by first initial(s).

313

Taylor, J. M., & Neimeyer, G. J. (2015).
Taylor, T. (2014).

The in-text citations for these references also include the initials of the first author (see Section 8.20). These guidelines apply to
only the first author in each reference.

If multiple first authors share the same surname and the same initials, order the works as described in Sections 9.46 and 9.47.
This  guideline  applies  regardless  of  whether  the  authors  are  different  people  or  the  same  person  with  a  name  change.  For
guidance on the corresponding in-text citations, see Section 8.20.

9.49 Order of Works With No Author or an Anonymous Author
Before treating a work as though it has no author, consider whether a group or organization is the author (see Section 9.11). If,
and  only  if‚  the  work  is  signed  “Anonymous,”  begin  the  entry  with  the  word  “Anonymous,”  and  alphabetize  the  entry  as  if
Anonymous were a true name.

If there is no author and the work is not signed “Anonymous,” the reference begins with the work’s title (see Section 9.12);
alphabetize the entry by the first significant word of the title (i.e., ignoring the words “A,” “An,” and “The” at the beginning of
the title).

Alphabetize numerals as though they were spelled out (e.g., alphabetize 22 as though it were “twenty-two”). Thus, “Top 100
business schools” precedes “Top 10 nursing specialties” because when spelled out, “one hundred” appears alphabetically before
“ten.” Likewise, “Theological studies” precedes “200 years” because “theological” precedes “two hundred.”

For citing works with no author in text, see Section 8.14.

9.50 Abbreviations in References
Some parts of books, reports, and other publications are abbreviated in the reference list to save space, including
the following examples. Many, but not all, reference abbreviations are capitalized.

9.51 Annotated Bibliographies
An annotated bibliography is  a  type  of  student  paper  in  which  reference  list  entries  are  followed  by  short  descriptions  of  the
work  called  annotations.  Annotated  bibliographies  can  also  constitute  one  element  of  a  research  paper  in  fields  that  require
bibliographies rather than reference lists. Most APA Style guidelines are applicable to annotated bibliographies. For guidance on
paper  margins,  font,  and  line  spacing,  see  Chapter  2.  This  chapter  provides  guidelines  for  creating  and  properly  ordering
references in an annotated bibliography. For templates and examples of reference list entries, see Chapter 10. When writing the

314

text  of  your  annotations,  consult  the  writing  style  and  grammar  guidelines  in  Chapter 4,  the  bias-free  language  guidelines  in
Chapter 5, and the mechanics of style guidelines in Chapter 6. In general, it is not necessary to cite the work being annotated in
the annotation because the origin of the information is clear through context. However, do include in-text citations (see Chapter
8) if you refer to multiple works within an annotation to clarify the source.

Instructors generally set all other requirements for annotated bibliographies (e.g., number of references to include, length and

focus of each annotation). In the absence of other guidance, format an annotated bibliography as follows:

Format  and  order  references  in  an  annotated  bibliography  in  alphabetical  order,  the  same  as  you  would  order  entries  in  a
reference list (see Sections 9.43–9.44).

Each annotation should be a new paragraph below its reference entry. Indent the entire annotation 0.5 in. from the left margin,
the same as you would a block quotation (see Section 8.27). Do not indent the first line of the annotation.

If the annotation spans multiple paragraphs, indent the first line of the second and any subsequent paragraphs an additional
0.5 in., the same as you would a block quotation with multiple paragraphs.

See Figure 9.3 for an example of an annotated bibliography.

9.52 References Included in a Meta-Analysis
Studies included in a meta-analysis (see Sections 3.12 and 3.17) should be incorporated alphabetically into the reference list for
the  paper;  the  meta-analysis  references  should  not  be  presented  in  a  separate  list.  Place  an  asterisk  at  the  beginning  of  each
reference that was included in the meta-analysis. On the first page of the reference list, below the “References” section label,
insert the following statement (indented as a new paragraph) describing the purpose of the asterisks: “References marked with an
asterisk indicate studies included in the meta-analysis.” See Figure 9.4 for an example.

References  included  in  the  meta-analysis  do  not  have  to  be  cited  in  the  text.  However,  they  can  be  cited  at  the  author’s

discretion (e.g., in a table for comparison; see Chapter 7, Table 7.4). In-text citations do not include asterisks.

R EFER EN C E EXA M PLES

Appropriately crediting the contributions of scholars on which your research and writing are based is a hallmark of scholarly
discourse.  These  contributions  must  be  cited  accurately  and  consistently  so  that  future  scholars  can  identify  and  retrieve  the
works cited in the text.

In  this  chapter,  we  provide  examples  of  references  in  APA  Style  and  their  corresponding  in-text  citations.  The  reference

examples are organized first by group, then by category, and then by type, as follows:

The textual works group (Sections 10.1–10.8) contains the categories of periodicals, books and reference works, edited book
chapters  and  reference  work  entries,  reports  and  gray  literature,  conference  sessions  and  presentations,  dissertations  and
theses, reviews of other works, and unpublished and informally published works. Within those categories are examples by
type (e.g., journal article, edited book chapter, government report, dissertation).

The  data  sets,  software,  and  tests  group  (Sections  10.9–10.11)  contains  the  categories  of  data  sets;  computer  software,
mobile  apps,  apparatuses,  and  equipment;  and  tests,  scales,  and  inventories.  Within  those  categories  are  examples  by  type
(e.g., unpublished raw data, entry in a mobile reference work, test scoring manual).

The audiovisual media group (Sections 10.12–10.14) contains the categories of audiovisual works, audio works, and visual
works.  Within  those  categories  are  examples  by  type  (e.g.,  YouTube  video,  speech  audio  recording,  podcast  episode,
PowerPoint slides).

The online media group (Sections 10.15–10.16) contains the categories of social media and webpages and websites. Within
those categories are examples by type (e.g., Instagram photo, tweet, webpage on a news website).

As described in Chapter 9, the key elements of a reference are the author (who), date (when), title (what), and source (where;
see  also  Figure  9.1).  For  each  reference  category,  a  corresponding  template  illustrates  the  order  and  format  in  which  these
elements should appear, and examples of the most common reference types follow. If you do not see an example that matches
the work you want to cite, use the template for the applicable reference category as a starting point for writing the reference list
entry.  Then  select  the  appropriate  option  from  each  column  of  the  template  to  write  the  reference.  Mix  and  match  elements
within a template; it is not necessary to use multiple templates. When in doubt, provide more information rather than less. For
every  reference,  the  in-text  citation  contains  the  first  two  parts  of  the  reference—usually  the  “who”  (author)  and  the  “when”
(date; see Section 8.11), although this can change if reference information is missing (see Table 9.1).

Most legal references (e.g., court cases and laws) are formatted in a legal reference style, which is different in several ways
from  the  author–date–title–source  pattern  of  other  APA  Style  references.  Legal  references  are  presented  in  Chapter  11.
Additional  reference  examples,  including  references  to  archival  documents,  are  available  on  the  APA  Style  website
(https://apastyle.apa.org) and on the APA Style blog (https://apastyle.apa.org/blog).

The following index of reference examples is organized by variations in each reference element. The numbers after each index

entry refer to the numbered reference examples in this chapter.

Textual Works

10.1 Periodicals

Periodicals are generally published on a continuous basis and include journals, magazines, newspapers, newsletters, and even
blogs and other online platforms that publish articles. Sometimes the distinctions between periodical types are ambiguous—for
example, a blog that is hosted on a newspaper website. Regardless of where the work appears, its reference list entry follows the
same pattern. The date element is presented in different formats for journal, magazine, and newspaper articles and blog posts
(see Examples 1, 15, 16, and 17, respectively). When periodical information (e.g., volume number, issue number, page range) is
missing, omit it from the reference. For online news websites, see Section 10.16 and Example 110. Use the template shown next
to construct references for periodical articles.

It is not necessary to note when you used an audiobook versus a book or an ebook when the content is the same, even if the format is different.
However, do note that the work is an audiobook in the title element when the content is different (e.g., abridged), if you want to note something
special about the audiobook (e.g., the impact of the narration on the listener), or if you quote from the audiobook (see Section 8.28).

If the audiobook was released in a different year from the text version of the book, treat the work as republished (see Example 29).

When the author and publisher are the same, omit the publisher from the source element.
It  is  common,  but  not  required,  to  identify  the  title  (and  edition)  of  a  diagnostic  manual  in  the  text.  Group  authors  and  manual  titles  can  be
abbreviated in the text (with a few exceptions) but not the reference list (see Sections 6.25 and 8.21).
Generally,  include  a  citation  for  a  manual  the  first  time  it  is  mentioned  in  the  text.  If  the  first  mention  appears  in  a  heading,  do  not  cite  the
manual in the heading; rather, cite it within the first paragraph of that section or soon thereafter.
Do  not  repeat  the  citation  for  a  subsequent  general  mention  of  a  manual.  Repeat  a  citation  only  when  it  directly  supports  a  statement  (e.g.,
quoting, paraphrasing).
Additional examples and guidance for citing other editions of and entries in the DSM and ICD are available on the APA Style website.

When an online reference work is continuously updated (see Section 9.15) and the versions are not archived, use “n.d.” as the year of publication
and include a retrieval date (see Section 9.16).

 48. Entry in a dictionary, thesaurus, or encyclopedia, with individual author

Graham, G. (2019). Behaviorism. In E. N. Zalta (Ed.), The Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy (Summer 2019 ed.). Stanford

University. https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2019/entries/behaviorism/

Parenthetical citation: (Graham, 2019)
Narrative citation: Graham (2019)

This example is structured similarly to the reference for a chapter in an edited book because the entry has an individual author, the encyclopedia
has an editor, and the whole work has a publisher.
Because this version of the entry is archived, a retrieval date is not needed.

 49. Wikipedia entry

List of oldest companies. (2019, January 13). In Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?

“View history” and then the time and date of the version you used. If a wiki does not provide permanent links to archived versions of the page,
include the URL for the entry and the retrieval date.

10.4 Reports and Gray Literature
There  are  many  kinds  of  reports,  including  government  reports,  technical  reports,  and  research  reports.  These  reports,  like
journal articles, usually cover original research, but they may or may not be peer reviewed. They are part of a body of literature
sometimes referred to as gray literature. The category of gray literature includes press releases, codes of ethics, grants, policy
briefs,  issue  briefs,  and  so  forth.  It  is  optional—but  often  helpful—to  describe  these  less  common  types  of  gray  literature  in
square  brackets  after  the  title.  Reports  themselves  sometimes  include  a  suggested  reference  format;  this  reference  usually
contains the information necessary to write an APA Style reference (author, date, title, and source), but you may need to adjust
the order of the elements and other formatting to conform to APA Style. When the publisher is the same as the author, which is
often the case for group authors (see Examples 50 and 54), omit the publisher from the source element. Use the template shown
next to construct references for reports and gray literature.

10.6 Dissertations and Theses
References  for  doctoral  dissertations  and  master’s  and  undergraduate  theses  are  divided  by  whether  they  are  unpublished  or
published;  unpublished  works  generally  must  be  retrieved  directly  from  the  college  or  university  in  print  form,  whereas
published  works  are  available  from  a  database  (e.g.,  the  ProQuest  Dissertations  and  Theses  Global  database),  a  university
archive, or a personal website. Thus, for unpublished dissertations and theses, the university name appears in the source element
of the reference, whereas for published dissertations and theses, the university name appears in square brackets after the title.

10.7 Reviews
Reviews of books, films, TV shows, albums, and other entertainment are published in a variety of outlets, including journals,
magazines, newspapers, websites, and blogs. The reference format for a review should be the same as the format for the type of
content appearing within that source, with the addition of information about the item being reviewed in square brackets after the
review title. Within the square brackets, write “Review of the” and then the type of work being reviewed (e.g., film, book, TV
series episode, video game); its title (in sentence case, described in Section 6.17; see also Section 9.19 for whether to format the
title in italics or quotation marks); and its author or editor, director, writer, and so forth, with a designation of role for all except
regular authors of books. Use the template shown next to construct references for reviews.

10.8 Unpublished Works and Informally Published Works
Unpublished  works  include  work  that  is  in  progress,  has  been  completed  but  not  yet  submitted  for  publication,  and  has  been
submitted but not yet accepted for publication. Informally published works include work that is available from a preprint archive
or repository such as PsyArXiv, an electronic archive such as ERIC, an institutional archive, a government archive, a personal
website, and so forth. Refer to the final published version of your sources when possible (see Section 8.5); remember to update
your references prior to publication of your work or submission for a classroom assignment to ensure they contain the most up-
to-date publication information.

For an unpublished or informally published work, the date should be the year the work was completed or the year the draft
was  written.  Do  not  use  the  words  “in  preparation,”  “submitted,”  or  “submitted  for  publication”  in  the  date  element  of  the
reference. After the title, describe the status of the work (e.g., unpublished, in preparation, submitted for publication) using the
appropriate  descriptor  for  the  work  (e.g.,  manuscript,  report)  in  square  brackets.  When  the  source  of  the  unpublished  work  is
known  (e.g.,  a  university  or  university  department),  include  it  in  the  source  element  of  the  reference.  Include  a  DOI  or  URL
when available for informally published works.

Data Sets, Software, and Tests

10.9 Data Sets

Citing data supports their discovery and reuse, leading to better science through the validation of results. It also recognizes data
as an essential part of the scientific record and acknowledges data creators for their contributions. We recommend that authors
include an in-text citation and a reference list entry for a data set when they have either (a) conducted secondary analyses of
publicly archived data or (b) archived their own data being presented for the first time in the current work (see also Section 1.14
on data retention and sharing).

The date for published data is the year of publication and for unpublished data is the year(s) of collection. When a version
number  exists,  include  it  in  parentheses  after  the  title.  The  bracketed  description  is  flexible  (e.g.,  data  set,  data  set  and  code
book).  In  the  source  element  of  the  reference,  for  published  data,  provide  the  name  of  the  organization  that  has  published,
archived, produced, or distributed the data set; for unpublished data, provide the source (e.g., a university), if known. Include a
retrieval date only if the data set is designed to change over time (e.g., if data are still undergoing collection; see Section 9.16 for
more on retrieval dates). Use the template shown next to construct references for data sets.

For an untitled data set, provide a description in square brackets of the publication status and focus of the data.
When the source of unpublished raw data is known (e.g., a university or a university department), include it at the end of the reference.

10.10 Computer Software, Mobile Apps, Apparatuses, and Equipment
Common software and mobile apps mentioned in text, but not paraphrased or quoted, do not need citations, nor do programming
languages. “Common” is relative to your field and audience—examples of software or apps that do not require citations include
Microsoft Office (e.g., Word, Excel, PowerPoint), social media apps (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter), survey software (e.g.,
Qualtrics,  Survey  Monkey),  Adobe  products  (e.g.,  Adobe  Reader,  Photoshop,  Adobe  Acrobat),  Java,  and  statistical  programs
(e.g., R, SPSS, SAS). If you used common software or mobile apps during your research, simply give the proper name of the
software or app along the with version number in the text, if relevant.

Data were analyzed with IBM SPSS Statistics (Version 25).
Clients had installed the Facebook app on their mobile devices.

However, include reference list entries and in-text citations if you have paraphrased or quoted from any software or app. Also
provide  reference  list  entries  and  in-text  citations  when  mentioning  software,  apps,  and  apparatuses  or  equipment  of  limited
distribution—meaning  your  audience  is  unlikely  to  be  familiar  with  them.  The  date  of  a  computer  software  or  mobile  app
reference is the year of publication of the version used. The titles of software and apps should be italicized in the reference list
entry  but  not  italicized  in  the  text.  To  cite  content  on  a  social  media  app,  see  Section 10.15.  Use  the  template  shown  next  to
construct references for software and mobile apps of limited distribution and for apparatuses or equipment.

10.11 Tests, Scales, and Inventories
To cite a test, scale, or inventory, provide a citation for its supporting literature (e.g., its manual, which may be an authored or an
edited book, or the journal article in which it was published; see Example 81). If supporting literature is not available, it is also
possible to cite the test itself (see Example 82) and/or a database record for a test (see Example 83). The title of a test, a scale, or
an inventory should be capitalized using title case whenever it appears in a paper. Although the test title may be italicized in a
reference (e.g., in the name of a manual or when the test itself is cited), in the text, the title of a test should appear in title case in
standard (nonitalic) type. A test database name (e.g., PsycTESTS, ETS TestLink) is included only for test database records (see
Example 83). Use the template shown next to construct references for tests, scales, inventories, or test database records.

Test  database  records  (e.g.,  records  from  PsycTESTS,  the  ETS  TestLink  collection,  or  the  CINAHL  database)  typically  provide  unique
descriptive  and  administrative  information  about  tests;  cite  the  database  record  if  you  use  this  unique  information.  Otherwise,  cite  the  test’s
supporting literature, if available.

Audiovisual Media

Audiovisual  media  may  have  both  visual  and  audio  components  (e.g.,  films,  TV  shows,  YouTube  videos;  see Section 10.12),
audio  components  only  (e.g.,  music,  speech  recordings;  see  Section  10.13),  or  visual  components  only  (e.g.,  artwork,
PowerPoint slides, photographs; see Section 10.14). The reference examples that follow are divided into those categories as an
aid to readers of this manual; however, they follow the same formats, so the guidance is presented together here.

The formats for audiovisual references follow a pattern based on whether the work stands alone (e.g., films, whole TV series,
podcasts,  webinars,  music  albums,  artwork,  YouTube  videos)  or  is  part  of  a  greater  whole  (e.g.,  TV  series  episodes,  podcast
episodes, songs from a music album).

The author of an audiovisual work is determined by media type, as shown next.

Describe the audiovisual work in square brackets—for example, “[Film],” “[TV series],” “[Audio podcast episode],” “[Song],”
“[Painting],” and so forth in the title element of the reference. In the source element of the reference, provide the name of the
production company for films, TV series, or podcasts; the label for music albums; the museum name and location for artwork; or
the name of the streaming video site that hosts a streaming video. To cite a direct quotation from an audiovisual work (e.g., from
a film), see Section 8.28; for interviews, see Section 8.7. If you want to reproduce an audiovisual work (e.g., a photograph or
clip art) rather than just cite it, you may need to seek permission from the copyright owner and/or provide a copyright attribution
per the terms of the image license (see Section 12.15 for more).

Narrative citations: Forman (1975), Fosha and Levenson (2017), and Jackson (2001)

The director should be credited as the author of a film. However, if the director is unknown (as with the Fosha & Levenson example), someone
in a similar role can be credited instead to aid readers in retrieving the work; the description of role in this case matches what is on the work and
is flexible.

It is not necessary to specify how you watched a film (e.g., in a theater, on DVD, streaming online). However, the format or other descriptive
information may be included—within the square brackets, following the word “Film” and a semi-colon—when you need to specify the version
used (e.g., when the film’s DVD release includes a commentary or special feature that you used, or when the film is a limited-release educational
video or DVD). Adjust this wording as needed.

However, the format or  other  descriptive  information  may  be  included—in  square  brackets,  following  the  word  “Album”  and  a  semicolon—
when you need to specify the version you used (e.g., when a version of an album includes special tracks or features you accessed). Adjust this

Online Media

10.15 Social Media

Cite only original content from social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram, Tumblr, LinkedIn, and so forth.
That is, if you used social media to discover content (e.g., you found a link to a blog post on Pinterest or Twitter) and you want
to cite the content, cite it directly—it is not necessary to mention that you found it through a link on social media.

Social media posts may contain text only, text with audiovisuals (e.g., photos, videos), or audiovisuals alone. Include the text
of a social media post up to the first 20 words. Note the presence of audiovisuals (in square brackets) after the text of the post
(see Example 105).

Social media posts might also contain nonstandard spelling and capitalization, hashtags, links, and emojis. Do not alter the
spelling and capitalization in a social media reference. Retain hashtags and links. Replicate emojis, if possible. If you are not
able to create the emoji, provide the emoji’s name in square brackets, for example, “[face with tears of joy emoji]” for �. The
full list of emoji names can be found on the Unicode Consortium’s website (http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/index.html). When
calculating the number of words in your paper, count an emoji as one word.

Use the template shown next to construct references to social media content.

10.16 Webpages and Websites
Use  the  webpages  and  websites  category  if  there  is  no  other  reference  category  that  fits  and  the  work  has  no  parent  or
overarching publication (e.g., journal, blog, conference proceedings) other than the website itself (see Section 9.2). If you cite
multiple webpages from a website, create a reference for each. To mention a website in general, do not create a reference list
entry or an in-text citation. Instead, include the name of the website in the text and provide the URL in parentheses (see Section
8.22 for an example).

For help in determining the author of a webpage or website reference, including how the author can be inferred from context
or found on an “about us” or acknowledgments page, see Example 113 as well as Section 9.7. Provide the most specific date
possible (see Section 9.15 for information on how to handle updated dates or reviewed dates)—for example, a year, month, and
day; year and month; or year only. When the author name and the site name are the same, omit the site name from the source
element. Include a retrieval date only when the content is designed to change over time and the page is not archived (see Section
9.16).

LEGA L R EFER EN C ES

In APA Style, most legal materials are cited in the standard legal citation style used for legal references across all disciplines.
However, legal style has notable differences from the APA Style references outlined in Chapter 10.

In this chapter, we provide information on how APA Style references differ from legal style references; general guidelines for
creating APA Style legal references; in-text citation forms for legal materials; and examples of common legal references used in
APA  Style  papers,  including  court  decisions,  statutes,  legislative  materials,  administrative  and  executive  materials,  patents,
constitutions  and  charters,  and  treaties  and  international  conventions.  For  the  sake  of  brevity,  only  United  States  and  United
Nations legal examples are provided in this chapter. For more information on preparing these and other kinds of legal references,
consult The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation (Bluebook, 2015).

General Guidelines for Legal References

11.1 APA Style References Versus Legal References

Existing legal references are usually already written in legal style and require few, if any, changes for an APA Style reference list
entry. Note that some court decisions are reported in multiple places, which is called parallel citation (see Example 6). When a
work  has  parallel  citations,  include  all  the  citations  in  your  reference  list  entry.  Existing  legal  citations  generally  include  the
parallel citations already, so you should not need to do additional research to find them. The in-text citation for a legal work is
created from the reference list entry (see Section 11.3).

Ensure that your legal references are accurate and contain all of the information necessary to enable readers to locate the work
being referenced. If you have questions beyond what is covered in this chapter, consult the Bluebook, a law librarian, or a law
school  website  for  help.  For  example,  the  Legal  Information  Institute  at  Cornell  Law  School  provides  free  guidance  on  legal
citations  (https://www.law.cornell.edu).  These  resources  will  help  you  verify  that  your  legal  references  (a)  contain  the
information necessary for retrieval and (b) reflect the current status of the legal authority cited to avoid the possibility of relying
on  a  case  that  has  been  overturned  on  appeal  or  on  legislation  that  has  been  significantly  amended  or  repealed.  Table  11.1
summarizes key differences between APA Style references and legal style references.

11.2 General Forms
A general form is provided for each of the legal reference types in the sections that follow. Each reference form usually includes
a popular or formal title or name of the legislation and the reference information, which is called the citation.

Note: The term “citation” is used differently for legal references than it is in standard APA Style. In this chapter, the legal reference
sense of the word “citation” is meant when it appears without the modifier “in-text.”

Refer to the published statutory compilation of legislative materials where the legislation is codified (e.g., a specific numbered
section  of  a  specific  volume  of  the  United  States  Code),  including  the  compilation’s  publication  date  in  parentheses,  if  the
legislation has been codified. If the legislation has not yet been codified, provide the identifying label for the legislation assigned
by  the  enacting  body  during  the  particular  legislative  session  (e.g.,  a  specific  section  of  an  act  identified  by  its  public  law
number).

For  both  legislation  and  court  decisions,  the  reference  may  be  followed  by  certain  additional  descriptive  information  that
pertains to the content of the legislation or court decision, the history of the legislation or court decision (e.g., later appeals of
court  decisions  or  later  amendments  to  legislation),  or  other  sources  from  which  the  legislation  or  court  citation  may  be
retrieved. Consult the Bluebook for the proper format for such additional information.

Because  legal  references  may  include  a  great  deal  of  information  (e.g.,  a  citation  to  a  case  may  include  information  about
appeals),  legal  reference  style  uses  abbreviations  to  make  references  shorter.  See  Table 11.2  for  some  examples  of  the  more
common legal abbreviations that appear in APA Style papers.

11.3 In-Text Citations of Legal Materials
Although the reference formats for legal materials differ from those of other kinds of works cited in APA publications, in-text
citations are formed in approximately the same way and serve the same purpose. Most legal reference entries begin with the title
of the work; as a result, most in-text citations consist of the title and year (e.g., Americans With Disabilities Act, 1990; Brown v.
Board of Education, 1954). If the title is long (e.g., for federal testimony), shorten it for the in-text citation (see Example 14), but

355

give  enough  information  in  the  in-text  citation  to  enable  readers  to  locate  the  entry  in  the  reference  list.  Examples  of  in-text
citations and reference entries for legal materials are given in the sections that follow.

Legal Reference Examples

11.4 Cases or Court Decisions

A reference for a case or court decision includes the following information:

title or name of the case, usually one party versus another (e.g., Brown v. Board of Education);

citation,  usually  to  a  volume  and  page  of  one  of  the  various  sets  of  books  where  published  cases  can  be  found  called
reporters,  which  typically  contain  decisions  of  courts  in  particular  political  divisions,  which  are  called  jurisdictions  (e.g.,
Federal Reporter, Second Series);

precise jurisdiction of the court writing the decision (e.g., U.S. district court, New York Court of Appeals), in parentheses;

date of the decision, in parentheses (in the same set of parentheses as the jurisdiction if both are present); and

URL  from  which  you  retrieved  the  case  information  (optional;  this  is  not  strictly  required  for  legal  citations  but  may  aid
readers in retrieval).

To create a reference list entry for the case you want to cite, first identify the court that decided the case and then follow the
relevant example. Often, the document about the case will have the relevant citation included, or it can easily be retrieved by
searching the internet for the name of the court decision and the word “citation.” When a reference list entry for a case or court
decision includes a page range, provide only the first page number. Do not provide the page range for the whole case or decision.

Note: Unlike other reference types, the title or name of a case is written in standard type in the reference list entry and in italic type in
the in-text citation.

Federal Court Decisions. The United States has both federal and state court systems. Within federal courts there are multiple
levels of authority, and decisions from these courts are published in different publications.

U.S. Supreme Court: Decisions from the U.S. Supreme Court, the highest federal court, are published in the United States
Reports (other reporters may also publish Supreme Court decisions). The template for Supreme Court decisions is as follows:

Reference list: Name v. Name, Volume U.S. Page (Year). URL
Parenthetical citation: (Name v. Name, Year)
Narrative citation: Name v. Name (Year)

U.S.  Circuit  Court:  Decisions  from  the  U.S.  Circuit  Court  are  published  in  the  Federal  Reporter.  The  template  for  U.S.
Circuit Court decisions is as follows:

Reference list: Name v. Name, Volume F. [or F.2d, F.3d] Page (Court Year). URL
Parenthetical citation: (Name v. Name, Year)
Narrative citation: Name v. Name (Year)

U.S. District Court: Decisions from the U.S. District Court are published in the Federal Supplements. The template for U.S.
District Court decisions is as follows:

Reference list: Name v. Name, Volume F. Supp. Page (Court Year). URL
Parenthetical citation: (Name v. Name, Year)
Narrative citation: Name v. Name (Year)

State  Court  Decisions.  At  the  state  level,  courts  also  operate  at  different  levels  of  authority,  although  different  states  have
different names for the levels. These levels are as follows:

State supreme court: The state supreme court is generally the highest state court (the state of New York is one exception; the
court of appeals is the highest court in that state).

State  appellate  court:  The  state  court  of  appeals,  also  called  appellate  court,  is  the  intermediate  court  wherein  precedent
begins to be established.

356

State trial court: The state trial court is the lowest court of the state. State trial court decisions are seldom cited because they
do  not  establish  precedent,  and  they  are  not  reported  in  the  prominent  legal  databases  Nexis  Uni  (formerly  LexisNexis
Academic) or WestLaw.

The template for state court decisions is as follows:

Reference list: Name v. Name, Volume Reporter Page (Court Year). URL
Parenthetical citation: (Name v. Name, Year)
Narrative citation: Name v. Name (Year)

 1. U.S. Supreme Court case, with a page number

Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954). https://www.oyez.org/cases/1940-1955/347us483

Parenthetical citation: (Brown v. Board of Education, 1954)
Narrative citation: Brown v. Board of Education (1954)

U.S.  Supreme  Court  decisions  are  published  in  the  United  States  Reports  (abbreviated  “U.S.”  in  the  reference).  For  example,  the  decision  to
eliminate racial segregation in public schools, Brown v. Board of Education, was published in Volume 347 of the United States Reports, on page
483, in the year 1954. Cite Supreme Court decisions as published in the United States Reports whenever possible; cite the Supreme Court Reporter
for cases that have not yet been published in United States Reports.

 2. U.S. Supreme Court case, without a page number

Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. ___ (2015). https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf

Narrative citation: Obergefell v. Hodges (2015)

The court decision to legalize same-sex marriage in the United States, Obergefell v. Hodges, occurred in 2015 and was published in Volume 576 of
the United States Reports. However, as of the printing of this Publication Manual, the paginated volumes of the United States Reports have been
published  only  for  decisions  through  the  2012  Supreme  Court  term.  For  cases  that  have  not  been  assigned  a  page  number  (like  Obergefell v.
Hodges), include three underscores instead of the page number in the reference list entry.

This  court  decision  regarding  whether  third  parties  should  be  protected  from  involuntarily  committed  psychiatric  patients  in  state  custody  was
rendered by the federal district court for the District of Kansas in the year 1981. On appeal, the decision was affirmed by the federal-level 10th
Circuit Court of Appeals in 1984. Information about both the original decision and the appealed decision appears in the reference list entry.

If on appeal the decision is affirmed, the abbreviation “aff’d” is used between the two components, in italics and set off by commas; if the decision
is overturned or reversed, the abbreviation “rev’d” is used, in italics and set off by commas.

Consult the Bluebook for the proper forms of the various stages in a case’s history.

The  court  decision  was  reported  in  three  places,  which  are  all  included  in  the  parallel  citation  (see  Section 11.1),  shown  here  separated  with
commas. These three sources are Volume 17 of the California Reports, Third Series (Cal.3d), page 425; Volume 131 of the California Reporter
(Cal. Rptr.), page 14; and Volume 551 of the Pacific Reporter, Second Series (P.2d), page 334. All three report locations are generally reported
together, so no additional research is needed to find them.

 7. State appellate court case

Texas v. Morales, 826 S.W.2d 201 (Tex. Ct. App. 1992). https://www.leagle.com/decision/19921027826sw2d20111010

Parenthetical citation: (Texas v. Morales, 1992)
Narrative citation: Texas v. Morales (1992)

This  court  decision  found  that  the  equal  protection  and  due  process  components  of  the  Texas  Constitution  prohibit  the  criminalization  of
consensual same-sex activity among adults in private. It was published in Volume 826 of the South Western Reporter, Second Series, page 201,
decided by the Texas State Court of Appeals in the year 1992.

11.5 Statutes (Laws and Acts)
A statute is a law or act passed by a legislative body. As with court decisions, statutes exist on both the federal and state levels,
such as an act passed by Congress or by a state government.

Federal  statutes  are  published  in  the  United  States  Code  (U.S.C.).  The  U.S.C.  is  divided  into  sections  called  titles—for
example, Title 42 refers to public health and welfare. New laws are then added to the appropriate title as a way of keeping the
law organized. State statutes are published in state-specific compilations; for example, statutes pertaining to the state of Florida
are published in the Florida Statutes. State statutes are also typically organized into titles.

In the reference list entry for a federal or state statute, include the name of the act; the title, source (abbreviated as specified in
the Bluebook), and section number of the statute; and, in parentheses, the publication date of the statutory compilation you used
(e.g., the U.S.C. or a state-specific compilation). You may include the URL from which you retrieved the statute after the year.
This is not strictly required for legal citations but may aid readers in retrieval.

In the in-text citation, give the popular or official name of the act (if any) and the year of the act. Determining the year for the
statute can be confusing because there is often a year when the statute was first passed, a year when it was amended, and a year
when it was supplemented. The year in the reference list entry and in-text citation should refer to the year in which the statute
was published in the source being cited. This date may be different from the year in the name of the act.

The template for federal or state statutes is as follows:

Reference list: Name of Act, Title Source § Section Number (Year). URL
Parenthetical citation: (Name of Act, Year)
Narrative citation: Name of Act (Year)

The  format  for  state  statutes  may  differ  depending  on  the  state  but  generally  follows  the  same  format  as  for  federal  statutes.
Consult the Bluebook or another legal resource for further information on your particular state. For example, a few states use
chapter or article numbers instead of section numbers; for a reference to a statute from one of these states, use the chapter or
article number in the reference in place of the section number. Use abbreviations or symbols as shown in the Bluebook.

To cite a federal statute (i.e., a law or act), cite the statute as it was codified in the United States Code. You may see a public
law number on the act as well; this number is used in the reference list entry when the act is codified in scattered sections (see
Example 9) or to refer to an act before it is codified (see Example 11).  However,  if  a  statute  has  been  codified  in  the  United
States Code in a single section or range of sections (see Example 8), it is not necessary to include the public law number in the
reference.

Next are several examples of acts commonly cited in APA Style papers. Citations to other federal statutes follow the same

format.

358

 8. Federal statute, Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990

Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. (1990). https://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08.htm

Parenthetical citation: (Americans With Disabilities Act, 1990)
Narrative citation: Americans With Disabilities Act (1990)

This act can be located beginning at Section 12101 of Title 42 of the United States Code and was codified in the year 1990. The phrase “et seq.” is
Latin for “and what follows” and is a shorthand way of showing that the act covers not only the initial section cited but also others that follow.

 9. Federal statute, Civil Rights Act of 1964

Civil Rights Act of 1964, Pub. L. No. 88-352, 78 Stat. 241 (1964). https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-78/pdf/STATUTE-78-

Pg241.pdf

Parenthetical citation: (Civil Rights Act, 1964)
Narrative citation: Civil Rights Act (1964)

The Civil Rights Act of 1964 is codified in the United States Code in three scattered sections: 2 U.S.C., 28 U.S.C., and 42 U.S.C. To cite the entire
act, use the public law number as shown in the example.

10. Federal statute, Every Student Succeeds Act

Every Student Succeeds Act, 20 U.S.C. § 6301 (2015). https://www.congress.gov/114/plaws/publ95/PLAW-114publ95.pdf

Parenthetical citation: (Every Student Succeeds Act, 2015)
Narrative citation: Every Student Succeeds Act (2015)

111publ2/pdf/PLAW-111publ2.pdf

Parenthetical citation: (Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, 2009)
Narrative citation: Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act (2009)

The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 amended Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (1964) and other acts and pertains to fair wage compensation.
Because it was not codified in the United States Code, cite the public law number. It was published in Volume 123 of the United States Statutes at
Large (abbreviated “Stat.”) beginning on page 5 in the year 2009.

12. Federal statute, Title IX (Patsy Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act)

Patsy Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. (1972). https://www.justice.gov/crt/title-ix-education-

Narrative citation: Patsy Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act (1972)

The  Patsy  Mink  Equal  Opportunity  in  Education  Act,  commonly  known  as  Title  IX,  prohibits  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  sex  in  federally
funded educational programs such as sports. It was published in Volume 20 of the United States Code, beginning at Section 1681, in the year 1972.
Note that “Title IX” refers to part of the Education Amendments of 1972, not Title 9 of the United States Code.

13. State statute in state code

Florida Mental Health Act, Fla. Stat. § 394 (1971 & rev. 2009). http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?

App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0300-0399/0394/0394.html

Parenthetical citation: (Florida Mental Health Act, 1971/2009)
Narrative citation: Florida Mental Health Act (1971/2009)

This Florida act can be found in the Florida Statutes,  Section  394.  It  was  first  codified  in  the  year  1971  and  then  revised  in  2009.  Both  years
appear in the in-text citation, separated by a slash.

Consult the Bluebook for formats for other states.

11.6 Legislative Materials
Legislative materials include federal testimony, hearings, bills, resolutions, reports, and related documents. Bills and resolutions
that have been passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the president become law and should be cited as statutes (see

number is a unique identifying code given to every patent. The year refers to the year the patent was issued, not the year
the patent was applied for.

11.9 Constitutions and Charters
To cite a whole federal or state constitution, a citation is not necessary. Simply refer to the constitution in text.

The U.S. Constitution has 26 amendments.
The Massachusetts Constitution was ratified in 1780.

Create reference list entries and in-text citations for citations to articles and amendments of constitutions. In the reference list
and  in  parenthetical  citations,  abbreviate  U.S.  Constitution  to  “U.S.  Const.”  and  use  the  legal  state  abbreviation  for  a  state
constitution (e.g. “Md. Const.” for the Maryland Constitution; see a list of state abbreviations for legal references at the Legal
Information Institute at https://www.law.cornell.edu/citation/4-500). In the narrative, use either “U.S.” or “United States” for the
U.S. Constitution, and spell out the name of the state for a state constitution—for example, “the Wisconsin Constitution.” U.S.
Constitution article and amendment numbers are Roman numerals. State constitution article numbers are also Roman numerals,
but  state  constitution  amendment  numbers  are  Arabic  numerals.  URLs  are  not  necessary  for  the  reference.  Additional
information about the cited source can be included in the narrative, if desired.

23. Article of the U.S. Constitution

Amendments to state constitutions are cited in the same way as amendments to the U.S. Constitution.

No date is needed in the reference unless the amendment has been repealed (see Example 26).

26. Repealed amendment to the U.S. Constitution

Template:
U.S. Const. amend. xxx (repealed Year).

Example:
U.S. Const. amend. XVIII (repealed 1933).

Parenthetical citation: (U.S. Const. amend. XVIII, repealed 1933)
Narrative citation: Amendment XVIII to the U.S. Constitution was repealed in 1933

Because the amendment was repealed, a year is included in the reference.

Repealed amendments to state constitutions are cited in the same way as repealed amendments to the U.S. Constitution.

27. U.S. Bill of Rights

U.S. Const. amend. I–X.

Parenthetical citation: (U.S. Const. amend. I–X)
Narrative citation: Amendments I–X to the U.S. Constitution

PU B LIC ATION  PR OC ESS

Authors, editors, reviewers, and publishers share responsibility for the ethical and efficient handling of a manuscript, beginning
when the editor receives the manuscript and extending through the life of the published article.

In this chapter, we provide authors with guidance on preparing for publication, including how to adapt a dissertation or thesis
into  a  journal  article,  prepare  a  manuscript  for  submission,  select  an  appropriate  and  reputable  journal  for  publication,  and
navigate  the  editorial  publication  process.  Following  are  sections  on  copyright  and  permission  guidelines  for  reprinting  or
adapting certain kinds of copyrighted works, the format for writing copyright attributions, and the steps to take during and after
publication.

Preparing for Publication

12.1 Adapting a Dissertation or Thesis Into a Journal Article

A dissertation or thesis often provides the foundation for a new researcher’s first published work. This original research can be
reformatted for journal submission following one of two general strategies.

The quickest strategy for “flipping” a dissertation or thesis into a published article or articles is to structure the work using a
multiple-paper format, wherein the final product submitted to fulfill the requirements for a degree consists of a paper or a series
of  papers  that  are  formatted  for  journal  submission  (or  close  to  it).  These  papers  are  usually  conceptually  similar  (and  often
come from the same overarching project) but can stand alone as independent research reports. Benefits of this strategy include
having  your  paper  already  formatted  for  and  at  a  length  consistent  with  journal  guidelines,  thereby  saving  time  and  effort  in
preparing for publication. In fact, you may even include manuscripts that are coauthored and under review, in press, or published
elsewhere in your dissertation or thesis, provided that all policies regarding article copyright are met (see Section 12.20). Talk to
your university’s editorial office beforehand to confirm that this is an acceptable format and to obtain the specific guidelines for
writing and structuring the dissertation or thesis.

A second strategy to convert a dissertation or thesis into a journal article after completing your defense is to reformat the work
to  fit  the  scope  and  style  of  a  journal  article.  This  often  requires  adjustments  to  the  following  elements  (see  the  APA  Style
website at https://apastyle.apa.org for more):

length: Shorten the overall paper length by eliminating text within sections, eliminating entire sections, or separating distinct
research  questions  into  individual  papers  (but  see  Section 1.16).  If  the  work  examined  several  distinct  research  questions,
narrow the focus to a specific topic for each paper. Consult the journal article reporting standards in Chapter 3 to learn more
about essential information to report in quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods research.

references: Include only the most pertinent references (i.e., theoretically important or recent), especially in the introduction
and literature review, rather than providing an exhaustive list. Ensure that the works you cite contribute to readers’ knowledge
of the specific topic and to the understanding and contextualization of your current research.

introduction  section:  Eliminate  extraneous  content  or  sections  that  do  not  directly  contribute  to  readers’  knowledge  or
understanding of the specific research question(s) under investigation. End with a clear description of the questions, aims, or
hypotheses that informed your research.

366

Method  section:  Provide  enough  information  to  allow  readers  to  understand  how  the  data  were  collected  and  evaluated
(following  the  journal  article  reporting  standards  in  Chapter 3);  full  details  about  every  step  or  the  rationale  behind  it  are
unnecessary. Instead, refer readers to previous works that informed the current study’s methods or to supplemental materials.

Results  and  Discussion  sections:  Report  the  most  relevant  results  and  adjust  the  discussion  accordingly.  Ensure  that  the
results  directly  contribute  to  answering  your  original  research  questions  or  hypotheses;  check  that  your  interpretation  and
application of the findings are appropriate.

tables and figures: Make sure that tables or figures are essential (see Chapter 7) and do not reproduce content provided in
the text.

Students seeking to prepare their dissertation or thesis for publication are advised to look at articles in the field and in relevant
journals to see what structure and focus are appropriate for their work. To gain insight into how journal articles look and what
they have and do not have, students might also consider reviewing an article submitted to a journal alongside their advisor (with
permission from the journal editor) or serving as a reviewer for a student competition. Doing so offers firsthand insight into how
authors  are  evaluated  when  undergoing  peer  review  (see  Section  12.7).  Additionally,  advisors  or  other  colleagues  may  be
coauthors  on  manuscripts  that  are  based  on  a  dissertation  or  thesis;  students  should  request  and  consider  the  input  of  these
coauthors during the conversion process (see Section 1.22 on the order of authors).

12.2 Selecting a Journal for Publication
Selecting a journal for publication should be an integral and early step of the writing process because the choice of journal can
shape the form of the manuscript. For example, journals vary in their length requirements; some journals publish brief reports in
addition to articles, whereas others publish only longer articles. Likewise, some journals reach a wide array of readers, whereas
others are more specialized. Additional considerations are the journal’s topical areas, open access policy, impact factor, time to
publication,  and  citation  style.  The  characteristics  of  a  journal  and  its  intended  audience  should  inform  your  journal  selection
process.

If you are unsure about how to select a journal for publication, take a look at your reference list as you write: What journals
do  you  cite  repeatedly?  What  themes  do  you  see  reflected  in  the  articles  published  in  that  journal?  You  can  also  look  at  the
reference lists of published articles that are similar to yours to get an idea of where researchers in your field are publishing. Also
ask coauthors or colleagues for recommendations. Follow up on possible leads by contacting the journal editor to make sure that
your topic is within the scope of the journal and would be of interest to its audience. Editors may be able to immediately tell you
that the article topic is outside the purview of their journal and even suggest a more suitable journal. Through this process, you
will begin to form a list of potential journals for publication.

The  next  step  is  to  narrow  this  list  down  to  one  or  two  possible  journals  by  assessing  two  factors:  appropriateness  and

prestige.

Appropriateness. Because all journals specialize in certain kinds of research, it is important that your research be appropriate
for the venue you choose. One of the most common reasons editors reject a manuscript is because the research is not appropriate
for the journal. To learn about a journal’s scope, peruse past issues and read the journal’s description on its website. Also consult
the journal’s manuscript submission guidelines and author instructions to identify the journal’s disciplinary and methodological
boundaries. Look for similarities with your paper in the following areas:

populations: Consider factors such as demographic characteristics, diagnosis, and setting (e.g., naturalistic vs. laboratory).

methods:  Consider  the  use  of  quantitative,  qualitative,  review,  meta-analytic,  mixed  methods,  and  other  approaches  (see
Sections 1.1–1.9).

themes: Consider the themes that unite the articles published in the journal.

article  features:  Consider  features  such  as  length  (e.g.,  brief  reports  vs.  long  reviews),  complexity,  citation  style,  and  so
forth.

Prestige. Publication in a prestigious journal will be a boon to your career and your work. When it comes to selecting a journal
for publication, it is important to keep in mind that more than one high-quality journal may be an appropriate fit for your article.
The prestige of a journal can be assessed in many ways; one way is by consulting indices such as the impact factor, rejection
rate, and number of citations to articles in the journal. Prestigious journals are peer reviewed, have an editorial board composed

367

of distinguished researchers in the field, and are included in trusted abstracting and indexing research databases in your field as
an indication of the journals’ reach to their key audiences.

12.3 Prioritizing Potential Journals
Publication is not a matter simply of submitting to the most prestigious journal possible but rather of identifying a set of the most
appropriate journals for your research and then selecting one that is well regarded. We suggest that you choose two journals to
which  to  submit  your  research:  your  preferred  choice  and  a  backup.  Remember  that  in  the  social  sciences,  you  can  submit  a
manuscript  to  only  one  journal  at  a  time,  so  prioritize  the  journals  accordingly.  Preselecting  two  potential  journals  will  help
alleviate the burden of reviewing journals again should your manuscript be rejected by the first.

If you are unable to decide between options, prioritize appropriateness over prestige. The goal of publication is to share your
research with your academic community; thus, if you publish in a prestigious journal but not an appropriate one, it will be harder
for interested readers to find your work. Researchers typically subscribe to certain journals to keep apprised of new and relevant
research and to receive alerts when new material is published. Therefore, choosing an appropriate and well-regarded journal for
publication allows your work to be noticed by researchers well acquainted with your discipline and to better contribute to the
growth  of  knowledge  in  the  field.  Other  considerations  that  may  inform  your  decision  are  the  time  to  first  response  or  to
publication  (which  may  be  relevant  to  graduate  students  looking  to  publish  articles  from  their  dissertation  or  thesis  before
graduation), publishing costs (which may be relevant to researchers without grant funding), whether it is a journal for which you
or your colleagues have been a reviewer, international scope or readership, and open access status.

12.4 Avoiding Predatory Journals
This section provides cautionary guidance for editors and authors. In the same way that authors are obligated to abide by ethical
and  professional  standards  when  conducting  research,  journal  editorial  offices  and  publishers  are  expected  to  be  rigorous  in
evaluating  the  articles  they  publish.  Unfortunately,  there  are  journals  and  publishers  that  engage  in  predatory  or  deceptive
practices, involving any number of unethical or negligent means of soliciting, evaluating, and/or publishing articles.

Predatory  journals  (also  called  deceptive  journals)  are  those  whose  publishers  aggressively  solicit  manuscripts  to  be
published  and  charge  fees  to  do  so  without  providing  services  to  justify  those  fees.  This  practice  is  also  called  deceptive
publishing.  Open  access  journals  that  charge  author  fees  for  publication  are  not  inherently  predatory,  but  predatory  journals
commonly use this model. These journals often have the following characteristics:

informal solicitation: The journal may solicit publication via an email that is informal (e.g., containing many exclamation
points), poorly written, and signed by an editorial assistant as opposed to the editor. If the editor is identified in the email or
journal website, check the editor’s website or CV to confirm that the journal editorship is listed.

hidden  publisher  or  website:  The  journal’s  website  or  publisher  may  be  purposefully  excluded  from  communications  to
avoid scrutiny, particularly if the journal’s name might be mistaken for the name of a leading journal in the field. If the only
links  in  the  email  are  to  the  online  peer  review  system  and  a  generic  editor  email  (e.g.,  JournalEditor@[publisher].com),
search for the journal online and review its website.

lack of rigorous evaluation: The journal may not use rigorous evaluation standards; for example, it may omit peer review or
use only a cursory peer review process and may lack editing, archiving, and/or indexing services (Bowman, 2014), resulting
in low-quality papers.

lack  of  transparency:  The  journal’s  website  may  make  it  difficult  to  locate  information  about  the  editorial  process  or
publishing operations (e.g., publishing fees, editorial staff; Masten & Ashcraft, 2017).

poor  reputation:  The  journal’s  publisher  may  not  have  a  good  (or  any)  reputation.  Its  website,  if  one  exists,  may  look
unprofessional and lack contact information (e.g., email, postal address, working telephone number). Impact factor or other
journal evaluation criteria may come with an asterisk indicating that they are “informal estimates” rather than real data.

nonstandard submission processes: The journal may use a generic (e.g., not labeled with a journal or organization’s name)
online peer review system or allow manuscript submission via email.

lack of indexing in databases: The journal and other journals by the same publisher may not be indexed in PsycINFO or
other  trusted  research  databases.  Although  inclusion  in  major  research  databases  is  not  an  ironclad  guarantee  of  journal  or
publisher good practice, database publishers usually have processes in place to evaluate and monitor the journals they cover.

368

Be  sure  to  search  for  the  title  of  the  journal  exactly  as  it  is  provided  in  the  email;  some  predatory  journals  have  titles
deceptively similar to those of reputable journals.

Reputable journals are usually indexed in research databases. PsycINFO’s journal coverage list, which includes publisher
information, is publicly available online (https://on.apa.org/2TRvolj).

Despite  sharing  one  or  more  of  these  general  characteristics,  predatory  journals  are  not  identical  in  their  practices.  Just  as
charging publishing fees or having an open access model are not universal markers of a predatory journal, the absence of these
practices  does  not  guarantee  that  the  journal  abides  by  high  standards  of  rigor  and  evaluation.  Ultimately,  it  is  the  author’s
responsibility to be diligent and to critically evaluate the standards used by potential journals.

High-quality  periodicals  typically  have  digital  object  identifiers  (DOIs)  for  their  articles  and  an  ISSN  for  the  periodical
(Beaubien & Eckard, 2014). Such journals usually have a well-defined scope that is aligned with the content of the articles they
publish; clearly described processes for peer review, correction, and retraction; and an identified publisher and editorial board
composed of individuals who are competent in their fields (Shamseer et al., 2017). If article processing or publishing fees are
levied, these fees are clearly posted on the journal’s website and are appropriate to cover the services rendered.

Resources  are  available  to  help  authors  vet  journals  and  discern  potentially  predatory  ones.  For  instance,  the  World
Association of Medical Editors (Laine & Winker, 2017) has published guidance to help editors, researchers, funders, academics,
and  other  stakeholders  distinguish  predatory  journals  from  legitimate  ones.  Shamseer  et  al.  (2017)  used  empirical  data  to
develop a set of evidence-based standards for identifying potentially predatory journals; these indicators provide a starting point
for  evaluating  journal  quality.  Both  the  Directory  of  Open  Access  Journals  (DOAJ;  https://doaj.org)  and  the  Quality  Open
Access Market (QOAM; https://www.qoam.eu) maintain white lists of reputable open access, peer-reviewed journals. Authors
can  visit  the  Think.  Check.  Submit.  website  (https://thinkchecksubmit.org),  which  provides  a  checklist  and  additional  free
resources  to  assist  in  identifying  trusted  journals.  The  Open  Scholarship  Initiative  (OSI,  2019)  also  provides  valuable
information about predatory or deceptive publishing.

If  you  have  questions  or  concerns,  contact  your  university  librarian,  who  can  help  ensure  that  the  journal  you  choose  is  a
legitimate one. The most important step you can take to protect the integrity of your research is to be diligent in evaluating a
potential journal before deciding whether to submit your article for publication.

Understanding the Editorial Publication Process

12.5 Editorial Publication Process

The editorial publication process begins when an author submits a manuscript to a journal for consideration. The flowchart in
Figure  12.1  describes  the  potential  paths  that  the  manuscript  can  take  from  submission  to  publication.  It  is  important  to
understand this process in context: Scholarly journal articles are original, primary publications, which means that they have not
been previously published, contribute to the body of scientific knowledge, and have been reviewed by a panel of peers. Work
that has been peer reviewed and appears in a journal with an ISSN or as a standalone work with an ISBN is considered published
(see Section 1.16 for more on duplicate publication). Although it is possible to informally publish by posting versions of a paper
online (e.g., on a preprint server), this alone does not constitute publication (see Section 12.23 for more on sharing your article).

369

Figure 12.1 Flowchart of Manuscript Progression From Submission to Publication

Full Description.

370

The peer-reviewed literature in a field is built by individual contributions that together represent the accumulated knowledge
of  the  field.  To  ensure  the  quality  of  each  contribution—that  the  work  is  original,  rigorous,  and  significant—scholars  in  the
subspecialties of a field carefully review submitted manuscripts. By submitting a manuscript to a journal that is peer reviewed,
an  author  implicitly  consents  to  the  circulation  and  discussion  of  the  manuscript  among  the  reviewers.  During  the  review
process, the manuscript is considered a confidential and privileged document; however, publisher policies differ, so check the
journal’s manuscript submission guidelines and instructions to authors (see Sections 1.20 and 1.23 for more on ethical standards
for manuscript reviewers).

12.6 Role of the Editors
Publication  decisions  for  a  journal  rest  in  the  hands  of  editors  who  are  responsible  for  the  quality  and  content  of  the  journal.
Journal editors look for manuscripts that (a) contribute significantly to the content area covered by the journal, (b) communicate
with clarity and conciseness, and (c) follow the journal’s style guidelines. Understanding the hierarchy of editors can help you
know what to expect as an author and how to correspond during the submission and publication process.

The  journal  lead  editor,  or  editor-in-chief, has  final  editorial  authority  on  decisions  regarding  manuscripts.  They  are  often
assisted  by  associate  editors,  who  assume  responsibility  for  a  specific  content  area  of  the  journal  or  for  a  portion  of  the
manuscripts submitted to the journal. For some journals, an associate editor may act as the editor at all stages of consideration of
a manuscript (i.e., as an action editor) and may communicate with authors regarding acceptance, invited revision, or rejection of
a manuscript. Consulting and advisory editors and ad hoc reviewers review manuscripts and make recommendations to editors
or to associate editors concerning the disposition of manuscripts. Editors often seek associate, consulting, or advisory editors to
advise  them  on  manuscripts  describing  methods  that  are  less  familiar  to  them  (e.g.,  qualitative,  mixed  methods)  and  to  assist
them in evaluating conflicting reviews in light of the logic of the approaches of inquiry in use (see Section 3.4). As an author,
you should address interim correspondence to the editor with whom you have been in communication. However, the lead editor
or editor-in-chief may make a decision other than that recommended by the reviewers or associate editor.

12.7 Peer Review Process
Just as understanding the role of editors helps you know what to expect during the submission process, so will understanding the
peer review process.

Reviewer Role. An action editor usually seeks the assistance of several reviewers who are scholars in the content area of the
submitted manuscript in arriving at an editorial decision. An action editor may solicit reviews from particular reviewers for any
number  of  reasons,  including  familiarity  with  the  research  topic  or  the  methodological  approach,  familiarity  with  a  particular
controversy, and a desire for a balance of perspectives. If reviewers do not have the knowledge to competently review a given
manuscript, they are expected to identify these limitations within their review or in communication with the editor.

Reviewers  provide  scholarly  input  into  the  editorial  decision,  but  the  decision  of  whether  to  accept  a  manuscript  for
publication ultimately rests with the action editor or editor-in-chief. Readers interested in learning more about the peer review
process or serving as a reviewer should consult APA’s online peer review resources (https://on.apa.org/2KCTE6O) and the APA
Reviewer Resource Center (https://on.apa.org/2F6MNn0).

When  you  submit  a  manuscript,  you  may  be  prompted  to  provide  a  list  of  potential  reviewers  along  with  their  contact
information (see Section 12.10 for more about online submission to a journal). Consider your choice of reviewers carefully and
with an eye to researchers whose own research is consistent with the topic of your paper, whose area of study is similar to yours,
and whose work has been cited in your manuscript. You may also consider potential reviewers’ establishment in the field (e.g.,
recent graduates may not have much of a scholarly record, whereas renowned scholars field many requests to review and may
not be available). Editors may not pick all (or any) of the reviewers you recommend. It is generally considered inappropriate to
suggest reviewers who are colleagues with whom you directly work because their familiarity with you and your work may bias
the review process, particularly if the journal does not participate in masked review.

Masked Review. Journal editors, either routinely or at the authors’ request, may use masked review in which the identities of the
authors of a manuscript are concealed from reviewers during the review process. Authors’ names are not revealed to reviewers
without the consent of the authors until the review process is complete. The names of reviewers can also be masked, although a
reviewer may choose to reveal their identity by including their name in the review itself. Thus, journals can mask review in both
directions  (both  authors’  and  reviewers’  names  masked),  mask  review  in  one  direction  (either  authors’  or  reviewers’  names
masked), or unmask the review (all names revealed).

Consult the author guidelines to determine whether the journal to which you are submitting routinely uses masked review or
offers masked review to authors who request it. Authors are responsible for concealing their identities in manuscripts that will
receive masked review; for example, they should format their manuscripts so their identities as document creators are not easily
revealed and describe the locations of their studies and participants in general terms (e.g., “students at a small, Midwestern U.S.
liberal arts college”).

Timing of Peer Review.  The  time  required  to  complete  a  peer  review  varies  depending  on  the  length  and  complexity  of  the
manuscript and the number of reviewers asked to evaluate it. If the journal editor determines that the manuscript is within the
purview  of  the  journal  and  has  no  major  flaws  or  limitations  (e.g.,  an  article  that  exceeds  prescribed  page  limits  often  is  not
considered for publication until revised), they will send it either directly to reviewers or to an associate editor who then serves as
the action editor. Associate editors, on the basis of the reviews received, then make a recommendation to the journal editor. It is
extremely rare that editors accept a paper for publication without formal peer review; exceptions might include an introduction
to a special section or an editorial.

In general, the review process takes approximately 2 to 3 months, during which authors can typically view the status of their
manuscript  (e.g.,  with  the  editor,  sent  out  to  reviewers)  through  the  journal’s  manuscript  submission  portal.  After  that  time,
authors can expect to be notified about a decision on their manuscript. It would be appropriate for an author to contact the editor
if no communication regarding a decision has been received after more than 3 months.

12.8 Manuscript Decisions
Reviewers provide the editor with evaluations of a manuscript on the basis of their assessment of the scholarly quality of the
manuscript, the importance of the contribution the work might provide, and the appropriateness of the work for the particular
journal. The decision to accept a manuscript, to invite a revision, or to reject it is the responsibility of the editor; the editor’s
decision may differ from the recommendation of any or all of the reviewers.

Acceptance. Once a manuscript is accepted, it enters the production phase of publication, in which it is copyedited and typeset.
During this phase, authors may not make significant changes to content (e.g., adding a new section of analysis or a table) other
than those recommended by the copyeditor. Authors are responsible for the completion of all associated paperwork (e.g., signing
copyright  transfers,  submitting  disclosures,  securing  permissions  for  any  reprinted  or  adapted  tables  and  figures).  Failure  to
complete  all  required  paperwork  may  result  in  retraction  of  the  acceptance  of  a  manuscript.  After  the  manuscript  is  typeset,
authors receive proofs that they are encouraged to review for typesetting errors and to which they can make minor revisions (see
Section 12.19 for more on reviewing article proofs).

Invitation to Revise and Resubmit. Manuscripts that are evaluated to have potential for eventual publication in the journal but
that are not yet ready for final acceptance receive an invitation to revise and resubmit. Manuscripts in this category range from
those that the editor has judged to need substantial reworking (including the possibility that additional empirical data need to be
gathered, that entirely new experiments need to be added, that analyses need to be modified, or that the manuscript needs to be
significantly shortened) to those that need only a small number of specific modifications. Some journals use a category called
conditional acceptance for this latter level of revision; in this case, the editor indicates that the article will be published in the
journal pending completion of specified changes. Invitation to revise and resubmit does not guarantee eventual publication of the
paper by that journal. In addition, the invitation may be time bound; it may not extend past a designated date or across changes
in editors.

Most manuscripts need to be revised, and some manuscripts need to be revised more than once (revision does not guarantee
acceptance).  Revisions  to  a  manuscript  may  reveal  to  the  author  or  to  the  editor  and  reviewers  deficiencies  that  were  not
apparent in the original manuscript, and the editor may request further revision to correct those deficiencies. During the review
process,  an  editor  may  ask  an  author  to  supply  material  that  supplements  the  manuscript  (e.g.,  raw  data,  complex  statistical
tables, instructions to participants). As the manuscript moves through the review process, editors are free to solicit reviews from
reviewers who were not among the initial set of reviewers. Additional reviewers might be selected if their expertise is needed or
if a previous reviewer is no longer available.

If the editor returns a manuscript to the author for revision, the editor explains why the revisions are required. The editor does
not  have  to  provide  the  reviewers’  comments  to  the  author  but  frequently  chooses  to  do  so.  Editors  do  not  undertake  major
editorial  revision  of  a  manuscript.  Authors  are  expected  to  attend  to  editors’  and  reviewers’  recommendations  for  revision;
however, the content and style of the article remain the sole responsibility of the authors.

372

Authors  should  respond  to  reviewers’  recommendations  thoughtfully  and  judiciously.  Frequently,  authors  are  required  to
resubmit  a  version  of  their  original  manuscript  with  tracked  changes  that  reflect  revisions  made  on  the  basis  of  reviewer
feedback. When resubmitting a revised manuscript, authors are also encouraged to enclose a cover letter thanking editors and
reviewers  for  their  feedback,  accompanied  by  a  document  explaining  how  they  have  responded  to  all  of  the  reviewers’
comments (regardless of whether they agreed or disagreed with the comments). Often referred to as a response to reviewers, this
file specifies how the authors addressed each critique made by a reviewer (e.g., by adding text or data) and where the revision
can be found in the revised manuscript. Authors are not required to make every change suggested by a reviewer, but the response
should explain the rationale behind the authors’ decisions, including decisions not to make a change. Providing a response to
reviewers facilitates the timeliness of the review process by reducing the number of follow-up questions and ultimately helps the
editor  decide  whether  to  publish  the  article.  For  a  sample  response  to  reviewers,  see  the  APA  Style  website
(https://apastyle.apa.org).

Some journals offer authors the opportunity to revise their paper into a brief report; the journal’s policies will indicate whether
this option exists. For such journals, authors may also submit a brief report initially. Articles of this type generally describe a
study  of  limited  scope,  contain  novel  or  provocative  findings  that  need  further  replication,  or  represent  replications  and
extensions  of  prior  published  work.  Research  published  in  this  format  generally  cannot  be  resubmitted  as  a  longer  research
article somewhere else (see Section 1.16 on duplicate publication).

Rejection. A manuscript is usually rejected because the work (a) is seen as falling outside the coverage domain of the journal;
(b)  contains  such  severe  flaws  of  design,  methodology,  analysis,  or  interpretation  that  the  editor  questions  the  validity  of  the
findings; or (c) is judged as making a limited contribution to the field, given the standards of the journal. At times, editors reject
good  manuscripts  simply  because  they  lack  the  space  to  publish  all  of  the  high-quality  manuscripts  that  are  submitted  to  the
journal.

Editors may desk reject a manuscript outright—that is, after an initial review but before review by an associate editor or by
reviewers—in two cases. The first is when the editor determines that the manuscript is not appropriate for the specific journal
because either the content or the format is not in keeping with the journal’s mission. The second is when the editor determines
that  it  is  unlikely  that  the  paper  will  be  evaluated  favorably  during  the  peer  review  process.  Both  decisions  allow  for  a  more
efficient and effective review process. Similarly, an editorial reject might occur when initial review of the manuscript reveals
formatting flaws such as exceeding the prescribed page limits.

A manuscript that has been rejected by a journal may not be revised and resubmitted to that same journal without invitation
from  the  editor.  If  a  manuscript  is  rejected  on  the  basis  of  the  peer  review,  the  editor  explains  why  it  was  rejected  and  may
provide feedback from the reviewers. Authors who believe a pertinent point was overlooked or misunderstood by the reviewers
may  contact  the  editor  to  appeal  the  decision.  Those  who  feel  that  their  manuscript  was  unfairly  rejected  should  consult  the
journal or publisher website regarding the appeals process. Authors are free to submit the rejected manuscript to another journal.
Reviewers may provide feedback that authors find useful when revising their manuscript; authors should give careful attention
to these comments and suggestions from peers and incorporate them to improve the scientific rigor and overall quality of the
paper.

Manuscript Preparation

12.9 Preparing the Manuscript for Submission

This  section  summarizes  the  steps  to  follow  in  preparing  a  manuscript  for  submission  to  a  journal.  First,  follow  APA  Style
guidelines  as  described  in  this  manual  when  formatting  and  writing  the  paper.  In  particular,  consult  Chapter  3  to  become
acquainted with the reporting standards for the type of research you have conducted. Also, check whether the journal to which
you are submitting your manuscript has a checklist or specific guidelines for manuscript submission. Manuscript preparation and
submission guidelines for APA journals can be found on the APA website (https://on.apa.org/2E0FPOT).

Many publishers, including APA, offer a suite of author services and support that provide help with writing, translation, figure
creation, and so forth. Authors are encouraged to use these services to ensure that the manuscript they submit to the publisher is
in  the  best  form  possible.  These  guidelines  and  services  are  continually  updated;  authors  should  follow  the  most  current
guidelines for the publisher to which they are submitting their work (for APA journals, see the Journal Manuscript Preparation
Guidelines at https://on.apa.org/2P01l9j).

373

12.10 Using an Online Submission Portal
You will most likely submit your article electronically through an online manuscript submission portal. For APA journals, each
journal  has  its  own  submission  portal  accessed  via  its  website.  Review  the  instructions  for  using  the  submission  portal  and
understand  the  format  for  saving  all  files  before  beginning  the  submission  process.  Guidance  on  navigating  the  Editorial
Manager system used by all APA journals can be found on the APA website (https://on.apa.org/2FLydBA).

Upon  submission  of  your  manuscript,  you  will  be  asked  to  upload  at  least  two  files—a  manuscript  file  and  a  cover  letter.

Additional files may be needed depending on the publisher’s requirements.

Manuscript File. The manuscript file consists of your manuscript, including the title page, abstract, text (body), and reference
list, as well as tables and figures, footnotes, and appendices, if applicable. Whereas some journals accept all sections as a single
file, others require authors to upload separate files (e.g., the title page in a separate file for masked review, all figures in separate
files).

If  you  are  submitting  supplemental  materials  with  your  manuscript,  check  the  journal’s  website  to  determine  the  preferred
format (see Section 2.15). Keep in mind that if your manuscript is accepted, your supplemental materials most likely will not be
copyedited  and  thus  will  be  made  available  to  readers  in  the  exact  format  in  which  you  submit  them.  Be  sure  to  review  all
supplemental materials carefully for content and proper format prior to submission.

Cover  Letter  File.  Authors  often  must  submit  a  cover  letter  as  a  separate  file  to  accompany  their  manuscript.  Check  the
journal’s website for the current editor’s name and for specific instructions on submission. See Section 12.11 for guidance on
what to include in the cover letter to the journal editor.

Additional  Information.  Finally,  you  may  need  to  supply  additional  information  via  the  submission  portal,  including  the
following:

article title and abstract
byline, affiliation, contact information, and order of authors
article word count or page count
number of tables and figures
keywords
names of potential reviewers (see Section 12.7)

Requirements  for  additional  information  are  specific  to  each  journal  and  publisher.  Follow  instructions  as  prompted  by  the
manuscript submission portal to ensure that you enter or upload all the requested information.

12.11 Writing a Cover Letter
When writing a cover letter requesting consideration of your manuscript for publication, include the information requested by
the journal. Cover letters often include the following:

specific details about the manuscript (e.g., title and authors)

assurances that all authors agree with the content of the manuscript and with the order of authorship (see Sections 1.21–1.22)

assurances  that  the  corresponding  author  will  take  responsibility  for  informing  coauthors  in  a  timely  manner  of  editorial
decisions,  reviews  received,  changes  made  in  response  to  editorial  review,  and  content  of  revisions  (if  the  manuscript  is
accepted, all the authors will need to certify authorship)

information about the existence of any closely related manuscripts that have been submitted for simultaneous consideration to
the same or to another journal (see Section 1.16 on piecemeal publication and exceptions)

notice of any conflicts of interest or activities that might be seen as influencing the research (e.g., financial interests in a test
or procedure, funding by a pharmaceutical company for drug research)

a request for masked review, if that is an option for the journal and you choose to use it (see Section 12.7)

verification that the treatment of human participants or nonhuman animal subjects was in accordance with established ethical
standards (see Sections 1.18 and 12.13)

a copy of any permissions granted to reproduce copyrighted material or a notice that permissions are pending (see Sections
12.14–12.18; the publisher must have copies of all granted permissions before your work can be published)

374

the telephone number, email address, and mailing address of the corresponding author for future correspondence

Some journals have an author agreement checklist that authors must submit along with or in lieu of a cover letter. Check the
specific  policies  of  the  journal  to  which  you  are  submitting  your  manuscript  and  follow  those  policies.  Nonadherence  to

12.12 Corresponding During Publication
While  a  manuscript  is  under  consideration,  it  is  the  responsibility  of  the  authors  to  inform  the  editor  of  any  substantive
corrections  needed,  any  changes  in  contact  information,  and  so  forth.  In  all  correspondence  during  the  publication  process,
include the complete manuscript title, the authors’ names, and the manuscript number (assigned when the manuscript was first
received).  Any  author  may  correspond  with  the  editor  or  editorial  staff  during  the  submission  and  publication  process.  Most
often, however, correspondence is handled by the corresponding author.

Following  publication,  the  corresponding  author  serves  as  the  main  point  of  contact  and  responds  to  questions  about  the
published article. All authors should decide prior to submission who will serve as the corresponding author. Although any author
can serve as the corresponding author, the corresponding author often has taken the lead in executing a study or heads the lab in
which the data were collected. See Section 2.7 for how to present the corresponding author’s information in the author note.

12.13 Certifying Ethical Requirements
In Chapter 1 (Sections 1.11 and 1.18), we noted that authors are responsible for demonstrating that they have complied with the
ethical  standards  that  govern  both  the  conduct  of  research  and  its  scholarly  publication  (see  Standard  8,  Research  and
Publication, of the APA Ethics Code; APA, 2017a). When you submit a manuscript to a journal, you may be asked to provide
proof of compliance with these standards. You are also expected to comply with legal standards of fair use when reprinting or
adapting the work of others and to comply with the publication policies established by the journal publisher. The forms APA
the  APA  website

Ethical  Compliance.  When  you  submit  your  manuscript,  you  may  be  asked  to  verify  that  you  have  complied  with  ethical
standards in the conduct of your research. This includes whether your study has been evaluated and approved by an institutional
review board (IRB) or an institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC), if such approval is required. Authors conducting
research outside the United States should describe the process of ethical review their study underwent if it differs from an IRB
evaluation.  Authors  submitting  to  APA  journals  are  also  required  to  submit  the  Certificate  of  Compliance  With  APA  Ethical
Principles Form (https://on.apa.org/2NrGSsY) if the research included human participants or nonhuman animal subjects.

Conflict of Interest. As discussed in Chapter 1 (Section 1.20), authors must disclose activities and relationships that, if known
to others, might be viewed as potential conflicts of interest—for example, financial agreements or affiliations with or potential
bias against any product or service used or discussed in the paper. Authors with no known conflict of interest must state this
explicitly.  Such  disclosures  should  appear  in  the  author  note  (see  Section 2.7).  For  APA  journals,  all  authors  are  required  to
submit  the  Full  Disclosure  of  Interests  Form  (https://on.apa.org/2E0FlIr).  For  more  information  on  conflicts  of  interest  and
ethical principles in research, please see APA Ethics Code Standard 3.06, Conflict of Interest.

Plagiarism Detection. Most publishers, including APA, now routinely submit manuscripts to plagiarism detection software that
compares the submitted work against millions of scholarly documents as well as content appearing on the open web. This allows
journal editors to check submissions for potential overlap with previously published material and to evaluate whether the overlap
is reasonable or problematic. See Sections 1.17, 8.2, and 8.3 for further information on plagiarism and self-plagiarism.

Copyright and Permission Guidelines

12.14 General Guidelines for Reprinting or Adapting Materials
Most of the time, authors need to provide only an author–date in-text citation and a reference list entry to properly credit the
words or ideas of other authors (see Chapters 8–11). However, according to U.S. copyright law, reprinting or adapting certain
kinds  of  works  (e.g.,  figures  published  in  journal  articles,  images  from  websites,  lengthy  quotations)  requires  a  more

375

comprehensive acknowledgment of the copyright status of the reprinted or adapted work in the form of a copyright attribution, a
brief  statement  providing  details  of  the  original  work  and  naming  the  copyright  holder  (see  Section  12.18  for  formatting
guidance).

Reprinting  means  reproducing  material  exactly  as  it  appeared  originally,  without  modifications,  in  the  way  in  which  it  was
intended. Adapting refers to modifying material so that it is suitable for a new purpose (e.g., using part of a table or figure in a
new table or figure in your paper). A copyright attribution is used instead of an author–date in-text citation to credit these works;
each work also should appear in the reference list. For a subset of cases (see Section 12.17), authors need to seek and obtain
explicit written permission from the copyright holder to reprint or adapt the material, a process that can take substantial time and
comes  with  no  guarantee  that  the  copyright  holder  will  consent  to  the  use.  Because  these  policies  are  a  matter  of  law,  not
specifically of APA Style, all writers—even students whose work will not be formally published—should follow them.

The remainder of this section guides authors through the process of

understanding what types of material require a copyright attribution;

identifying the copyright status of the material and understanding its implications for the intended use;

determining  whether  permission  is  necessary  to  reproduce  the  material  on  the  basis  of  its  copyright  status  and  the  legal
concept of fair use;

securing permission (if necessary) to reproduce the material; and

writing the copyright attribution in APA Style.

12.15 Materials That Require a Copyright Attribution
The following are examples of materials that authors often want to reprint or adapt that may require a copyright attribution; they
may also require permission (see Section 12.17). Other materials may also require a copyright attribution and permission before
they can be reprinted or adapted, such as songs, poetry, and art.

figures, tables, and other images: Most types of visual displays require a copyright attribution to reprint or adapt, including
tables and figures published in journal articles, books, reports, webpages and websites, and other works, as well as images
from  the  internet  such  as  illustrations,  infographics,  photographs,  screenshots,  and  most  clip  art.  Depending  on  the  work’s
place of publication and copyright status, permission may or may not be required. Copyright ownership and permission status
can be particularly difficult to establish for images downloaded from the internet, but journals cannot publish them without
full documentation. There is no need to seek permission or to write a copyright attribution for images taken from a database
whose purpose is the open dissemination of stimuli for academic research (e.g., the International Affective Picture System);
for these, an author–date citation suffices.

data: Published or unpublished data from another source require a copyright attribution and permission to directly reproduce.
Data  that  have  been  reconfigured  or  reanalyzed  to  produce  different  numbers  do  not  require  permission  or  a  copyright
attribution; cite these data with a regular author–date citation instead (see Section 10.9).

test  and  scale  items,  questionnaires,  vignettes,  and  so  forth:  Items  reprinted  or  adapted  from  copyrighted  and
commercially  available  tests  or  scales  (e.g.,  Minnesota  Multiphasic  Personality  Inventory–2,  Wechsler  Adult  Intelligence
Scale, Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales) require a copyright attribution and permission. Obtaining these permissions can be
difficult and time consuming, and a preferable alternative to reproducing the exact items in your manuscript may be to instead
reword  or  paraphrase  those  items.  Permission  is  required,  and  may  be  denied,  to  reproduce  even  one  item  from  such
instruments. Furthermore, many test and scale developers ask authors to submit a request (typically through their website or
email)  to  use  their  measure  prior  to  the  authors  administering  it  to  participants  in  their  study  and  to  inform  them  of  any
publications that may result from its use. Likewise, the developers should be consulted before you make any changes to a
measure  (e.g.,  adaptations  for  different  age  groups,  translation  of  specific  items).  Authors  should  also  consider  whether
reprinting  or  adapting  test  materials  could  threaten  the  materials’  integrity  and  security,  as  described  in  APA  Ethics  Code
Standard 9.11, Maintaining Test Security.

long quotations: Although most quotations taken from a published work need only an author–date citation, you should seek
permission  and  provide  a  copyright  attribution  to  reproduce  a  long  quotation,  the  definition  of  which  varies  by  copyright
holder. It is the author’s responsibility to determine the policy of each copyright holder; large publishers usually provide their
permission policies on their websites. For APA’s policy, see Section 12.17.

376

Two special cases of material with copyright requirements are commercial stock photography and clip art. If you find photos,
clip art, and other images via an online search engine, the guidelines in this section apply to those search results, too.

commercial  stock  photography:  Unless  a  stock  image  has  a  Creative  Commons  license  (see  Section  12.16)  or  is  in  the
public domain, it is not permissible to reproduce it without purchasing a license from the vendor. Commonly used vendors of
stock images are Getty Images, Shutterstock, and iStock. A license usually allows the license holder to reproduce the image
without a copyright attribution; however, without your own license, you cannot reproduce the image.

clip  art:  Most  clip  art  does  not  require  permission  to  reproduce,  but  it  may  require  a  copyright  attribution.  For  clip  art
included with a computer program (e.g., Microsoft Word), purchase of the program provides a license for that clip art, and
you can use it in an academic paper or scholarly article without a copyright attribution or author–date citation. If the clip art
comes from a free clip art website, check the copyright status of the image to determine whether a copyright attribution or
citation is needed (see Section 12.16). See Example 98 in Chapter 10 for a reference list entry for clip art when a reference is
needed.

12.16 Copyright Status
The copyright status of a work determines how you are allowed to use it in your own paper. Copyright is usually indicated on the
first page of an article, on the copyright page of a book or report, below an image published online, or in the footer of a website.

The following are some common copyright statuses:

standard copyright: Copyright is often indicated simply by the word “copyright” or the copyright symbol.

Copyright 2020 by the American Psychological Association.
© 2018 Bianca T. Burquest, all rights reserved.

Sometimes  determining  who  holds  a  copyright  can  be  a  challenge,  particularly  for  older  works,  because  publishers  may
merge and copyrights may change hands. Materials described in Section 12.15 require a copyright attribution, and permission
may be required as well.

Creative Commons copyright: Creative Commons licenses are indicated by “Creative Commons” or “CC.” Most Creative
Commons licenses allow you to reprint and/or adapt a work (including images) without permission from the copyright holder
as  long  as  you  give  credit  to  the  original  author  in  the  form  of  a  copyright  attribution,  note  the  license  type,  and  indicate
whether you have adapted the original. The specific terms of Creative Commons licenses vary, so check the license associated
with the work you want to reproduce to determine what you are allowed to do and what specific copyright attributions, if any,
are required.

public domain: Works that are not bound by copyright are considered to be in the public domain. This means that you can
reprint  them  and/or  adapt  them  however  you  want,  so  long  as  you  credit  the  original  author  in  the  form  of  a  copyright
attribution. Assume that a work is under copyright unless you see the words “public domain” on it or the work was produced
by the U.S. government (in which case it is automatically in the public domain). Although copyright does expire with time—
meaning  that  works  that  were  once  copyrighted  may  now  be  in  the  public  domain—the  laws  governing  this  process  are
complex and vary by country; consult a librarian if you have questions regarding expired copyrights.

no copyright indicated: If no copyright is indicated, treat the material as copyrighted. U.S. copyright law states that a work
is copyrighted as soon as it is fixed in tangible form (e.g., when you can see it on a computer screen or on paper), even if the
work  does  not  have  the  word  “copyright”  or  the  copyright  symbol  on  it,  and  even  if  it  is  not  widely  distributed  or
professionally published. For example, students automatically own the copyright to their classroom assignments.

12.17 Permission and Fair Use
Determining Whether Permission Is Necessary. Permission is not required to reprint or adapt a work (see Section 12.15  for
examples) when it has a Creative Commons license or is in the public domain; however, a copyright attribution is still required
in most cases. For works that are copyrighted (or for which the copyright status is unknown), permission is not always required
to reprint or adapt the work. The nature of the original publication (i.e., an academic work vs. a commercial publication) and the
concept of fair use govern whether permission is needed.

Scholarly  Works.  The  journal  publisher  typically  owns  the  copyright  on  material  published  in  its  journals.  Many  scientific,
technical,  and  medical  publishers  (including  APA)  do  not  require  written  permission  or  fees  to  reproduce  content  under  the

377

following circumstances:

The purpose of the use is scholarly comment, noncommercial research, or educational.

Full credit is given to the author and the publisher as copyright holders through a complete and accurate copyright attribution.

A maximum total of three figures or tables are being reprinted or adapted from a journal article or book chapter.

Single text extracts being reprinted are fewer than 400 words, or a series of text extracts being reprinted totals fewer than 800
words.  For  quotations  under  these  thresholds,  use  an  author–date  citation  (permission  and  copyright  attributions  are  not
required).

All  publishers  have  their  own  permission  policies,  which  may  differ  from  guidelines  provided  here  and  may  cover  cases  not
described  in  this  section  (e.g.,  reproducing  whole  articles  or  chapters).  Check  with  the  publisher  of  the  material  to  determine
whether permission is necessary.

Fair Use. You may be able to reprint or adapt a copyrighted work as described in Section 12.15 without permission if your use is
considered “fair.” Fair use is a loosely defined and complex legal concept (for a summary, see U.S. Copyright Office, 2019) but,
in general, means that under certain circumstances it is permissible to reprint or adapt a copyrighted table, figure, image, test
item, questionnaire, or long quotation without obtaining permission as long as you credit the work with a copyright attribution. If
in  doubt,  check  with  the  copyright  holder  to  determine  what  they  consider  fair  use,  especially  for  items  from  measures,
questionnaires, scales, tests, or instruments. However, the use is probably fair if it meets the following criteria:

It is for use in an academic work and not for profit (e.g., paper for a class, article in a scholarly journal).

It represents facts or data (e.g., a chart or diagram) rather than creative self-expression (e.g., artwork, although some famous
works of art are in the public domain and thus do not require permission).

It is small in relation to the entire work (e.g., a chart within a report) and not the whole work or the heart of the work (e.g., a
whole cartoon).

Reproducing the work will not hurt the market or potential market for the original.

Permission for Photographs of Identifiable People. If you photographed a person who is identifiable in the photograph, you
must submit a signed release from that person for the photograph to be published. The release should specify that both electronic
and print permissions are granted. This is not a matter of copyright but rather of permission from the individual to have their
likeness  reproduced.  It  is  not  necessary  to  mention  the  release  in  the  paper  or  to  write  a  copyright  attribution  for  such  a
photograph. No release is necessary if the photograph is of one of the authors of the paper.

Securing Permission. When permission is required, you must request permission to reproduce the material in all formats (e.g.,
both print and electronic) from the copyright holder. Permission extends in some cases to all subsequent editions and to foreign-
language  editions  as  well.  Permission  policies  vary  among  organizations;  always  check  with  the  publisher  about  whether
permission is required for subsequent or foreign-language editions of a publication.

Many publishers provide a way for authors to request permission on their websites (e.g., to request permission to reprint or
adapt material published by APA, see https://on.apa.org/2Aswon8). Permission can also be secured via email, fax, or mail. The
permission request should specify the details about the material (e.g., title of the work, year of publication, page number) and the
nature of the reuse (e.g., in a journal article). Some publishers also require that you obtain permission from the author of the
original work. Publishers normally grant permission contingent on the inclusion of a copyright attribution and payment of a fee
per table, figure, or page.

Allow ample time (several weeks) to secure permission. Once permission is granted, you need to

obtain that permission in writing;

include  copies  of  permission  letters  with  the  accepted  manuscript  (if  submitting  for  publication;  otherwise,  provide  them
when submitting an assignment);

complete the Permissions Alert Form for APA Journal Authors (if publishing in an APA journal); and

include  a  copyright  attribution  in  the  manuscript,  following  the  wording  and  format  described  in Section 12.18  or  specific
wording provided by the copyright holder.

378

Most  publishers  will  not  allow  your  manuscript  to  enter  the  production  stage  until  all  print  and  electronic  permissions  are
secured and documentation has been provided.

12.18 Copyright Attribution Formats
An APA Style copyright attribution contains information from the reference list entry of the work, but in a different order than in
the reference entry, and with additional information about the material’s copyright and permission status. To write a copyright
attribution,

state whether the material was reprinted or adapted (use “From” for reprintings and “Adapted from” for adaptations);

provide the title, author, year of publication, and source of the material;

indicate the material’s copyright status, which will be the copyright year and the name of the copyright holder, a statement
that the work is licensed in the Creative Commons, or a statement that the work is in the public domain; and

provide the permission statement as requested by the copyright holder if permission was sought and obtained.

Place the copyright attribution as follows:

For a reprinted or adapted table, figure, or other image (including reproduced [but not reanalyzed] data in a table), place the
copyright attribution at the end of the general note for the table or figure (see Sections 7.14 and 7.28).

For reproduced test items, questionnaires, or long quotations, place the copyright attribution in a footnote to the reproduced
text (see Section 2.13).

See Table 12.1 for copyright attribution templates and Table 12.2 for examples. See Chapter 7 for examples in context, including

an adapted table that does not require permission (Table 7.14 in Section 7.21),

a reprinted figure that does not require permission (Figure 7.3 in Section 7.36),

a reprinted figure in the public domain (Figure 7.14 in Section 7.36), and

a figure reproduced with permission (Figure 7.21 in Section 7.36).

Note. This table shows examples of copyright attributions you would include when reprinting or adapting a table or figure from another work in an academic
paper. Place the copyright attribution for a reprinted or adapted table or figure at the end of the table or figure general note (see, e.g., Table 7.14 and Figure
7.3). See Sections 12.14 to 12.18 to determine when a copyright attribution (and possibly also permission) is necessary. You may need to use different
wording than shown here depending on the requirements of the copyright holder.

When you use a copyright attribution, also provide a reference list entry for the work. However, the copyright attribution is used
instead of an in-text citation; it is not necessary to include both.

During and After Publication

12.19 Article Proofs

After  your  manuscript  has  been  accepted,  but  prior  to  its  publication,  you  will  be  contacted  by  the  journal’s  editorial  staff  to
review  the  article  proofs.  Proofs  are  usually  handled  via  an  annotation  website.  Through  the  site,  you  will  be  able  to  make
changes or annotations directly to the proofs to correct minor style or formatting errors. It is also where you will receive and be
asked  to  respond  to  specific  questions  posed  by  copyeditors  or  editorial  staff.  Keep  in  mind  that  the  proof  stage  is  your  last
chance to change your article. This is not, however, the time to rewrite text or to add new analyses, citations, or interpretation.
Any major revisions to the text or analyses made in the proofs may require review by the editor.

Review the proofs carefully. Be alert for changes in meaning that may have inadvertently occurred during copyediting, and be
attentive  to  levels  of  heading  and  formatting  of  statistics,  equations,  tables,  and  so  forth.  Copyeditors  correct  errors,  ensure
consistency of style, and clarify expression; you should compare the proofs with your original manuscript to confirm that any
changes  are  consistent  with  the  meaning  you  intended  to  convey.  Limit  changes  to  fixing  spelling  or  grammar,  correcting
copyediting or typesetting errors, and updating references (e.g., to update in-press citations, to fix DOIs and URLs that no longer
work). If you request changes, be explicit, because the typesetter will have only your written instructions to work from and thus
will need clear direction to implement the changes correctly. In addition, be sure to check the following:

Have you answered all copyeditor queries fully?

Are author names and affiliations correct and consistent with prior publications?

Is the hierarchy of headings and subheadings correct?

Are all numbers and symbols in text, tables, and mathematical and statistical copy correct?

Are tables correct? Are all columns aligned as expected, and do superscripts correspond to table notes? Are all table notes
correct?

380

Are  figures  correct?  Are  labels  properly  spelled?  Do  symbols  in  the  legend  match  those  in  the  figure?  Are  photographs
reproduced successfully? Are all figure notes correct?

If coauthors participate in reviewing the proofs, the corresponding author is responsible for consolidating necessary changes and
incorporating  them  into  the  proofs.  It  is  important  to  submit  your  requested  changes  to  the  publisher  within  the  established
deadline so that publication of your article is not delayed.

Once  you  have  submitted  all  proof  corrections  to  the  production  office,  your  article  will  soon  be  made  available.  Often,
publishers publish the final, typeset article online first, referred to as advance online publication, with the print version to follow
(see Section 8.5). This is the point of official publication, and your article may now be discovered and cited.

12.20 Published Article Copyright Policies
Until publication, the copyright of a manuscript belongs to the author(s). At publication, however, it is common for the copyright
of the work to change. Two of the most common scenarios are transfer of copyright to the publisher and entry into the public
domain.

Transfer of Copyright to the Publisher. When a manuscript is accepted for publication, authors typically transfer copyright of
their  manuscript  to  the  publisher.  By  transferring  copyright,  authors  permit  publishers  to  (a)  widely  distribute  the  article,  (b)
monitor  and  control  republication  of  the  article  (in  whole  or  in  part)  by  others,  and  (c)  handle  the  paperwork  involved  in
copyright  registration  and  administration.  The  publisher  in  turn  represents  the  authors’  interests  and  permits  authors  to  freely
reuse their own article (in whole or in part) in several ways. By law, publishers own the copyright on their journal articles for 95
years  from  the  time  of  publication.  The  copyright  transfer  includes  both  print  and  electronic  rights  to  the  article  to  allow  the
publisher  to  disseminate  the  work  as  broadly  as  possible.  APA  journals  use  the  APA  Publications  Rights  Form  (see
https://on.apa.org/32psDvX) to complete the transfer of copyright.

Public  Domain  Copyright  for  Employees  of  the  U.S.  Government.  If  the  primary  authors  are  employees  of  the  U.S.
government and its departments (e.g., Veterans Affairs) and the work was performed within the scope of their employment, the
work  is  considered  in  the  public  domain  (i.e.,  not  copyrighted  by  the  authors  or  publisher;  see  Section 12.16).  In  the  case  of
work performed under U.S. government contract, the publisher may retain the copyright (meaning it is not in the public domain)
but grant the U.S. government royalty-free permission to reproduce all or portions of the article and authorize others to do so for
U.S.  government  purposes;  authors  who  want  to  reprint  or  adapt  material  from  such  a  work  should  provide  a  copyright
attribution  and  determine  whether  permission  is  necessary.  APA  journals  use  the  APA  Publications  Rights  Form  (see
https://on.apa.org/32psDvX) to document when work has been produced by employees of the U.S. government.

12.21 Open Access Deposit Policies
Many funders and institutions around the world mandate that the work they sponsor be made freely available—or deposited in
open access repositories—to the public upon publication, the idea being that sponsored research findings should be in the public
domain to accelerate human progress. In practice, open access can take several forms, and funders and institutions outline the
format(s)  they  accept  or  require.  For  example,  some  require  a  prepublication  copy  of  the  final  manuscript  as  accepted  for
publication  to  be  posted  to  a  designated  repository.  Others  require  that  the  final  journal  article  be  made  freely  available
immediately  upon  publication—rather  than  limited  by  journal  subscription  access—with  minimal  or  no  barriers  to  reuse  (i.e.,
readers  can  disseminate  and  build  on  open  access  work  without  the  traditional  constraints  of  copyright  on  academic
publications).  Publishers  usually  support  the  open  access  publication  model  through  article  processing  charges  paid  by  the
authors using funder or institutional resources designated for this purpose.

As you decide where to submit your article, check your funder and institutional guidelines on open access and compare these
to the options supported by different publishers. If you are considering an open access APA journal, consult the APA Journals
website (https://on.apa.org/2vJ3oGq).

12.22 Writing a Correction Notice
As described in Section 1.13, errors sometimes occur in published journal articles. If you detect an error in your published article
(including  the  advance  online  publication)  and  think  that  a  correction  is  warranted,  submit  a  correction  notice  to  the  journal
editor and publisher. A formal correction tells readers (a) exactly what the error was, (b) what the correct information is, and (c)
whether some or all versions of the original article have been corrected (i.e., no longer contain the error). Because it is not the

381

purpose of corrections to place blame for mistakes, correction notices do not identify the source of the error (e.g., unintentional
oversight, mathematical errors).

It is not necessary to formally correct every error found in a published article. Minor typographical errors do not need to be

called out as part of the public record of science. The following are examples of errors that need formal, public correction:

adding an author or rearranging the order of authorship

completely  changing  the  affiliation  (e.g.,  because  the  affiliation  on  the  published  work  does  not  reflect  where  the  author
worked when the study was conducted)

replacing an entry in the reference list with a completely different reference

altering the data in a way that may or may not change the significance of the results

substituting one word for another or rewriting a sentence or paragraph in a way that substantially impacts the meaning

A correction notice should contain the following:

journal  title  and  year,  volume  number,  issue  number,  DOI,  and  inclusive  page  numbers  of  the  article  being  corrected  (as
applicable)

complete article title and names of all authors, exactly as they appear in the published article

precise location of the error (e.g., page, column, line)

an exact quotation of the error or, in the case of a lengthy error or an error in a table or figure, an accurate paraphrasing of the
error

a concise, unambiguous wording of the correction or, in the case of an error in a table or figure, a replacement version of the
table or figure

Once the proposed correction has been reviewed by the editor and publisher, a decision is made to either move forward with a
correction  notice  or  leave  the  error  within  the  published  article  as  is.  When  a  correction  is  approved,  the  publisher  uses  the
information  provided  by  the  author  to  compile  the  correction  notice  in  an  official  template.  Correction  notices  are  usually
published with a DOI, like published articles, and appear in print and online. If the article being corrected has already appeared
in  print,  the  correction  notice  is  published  in  the  next  available  issue  of  the  journal.  If  the  article  being  corrected  has  not  yet
appeared in print, the correction notice is published within the same issue as the article. If the article being corrected has been
published  only  online  and  will  remain  so  after  the  next  issue  of  the  journal,  an  online  version  of  the  correction  notice  is
published to amend the article while the article and correction notice await placement in a print issue. See the APA Style website
for sample correction notices (https://apastyle.apa.org).

12.23 Sharing Your Article Online
Certain rights are linked to copyright ownership, including the exclusive right to reproduce and distribute the copyrighted work.
Journals  are  committed  to  publishing  original  scholarship  and  distributing  peer-reviewed  articles,  in  both  print  and  electronic
formats, that serve as the version of record. Thus, many publishers have policies delineating the terms under which authors may
post an article on the internet.

Many  publishers,  including  APA,  allow  authors  to  post  a  version  of  their  manuscript  online—for  example,  in  a  preprint
archive or repository such as PsyArXiv, in an electronic archive such as ERIC, in an institutional archive, on a personal website,
on their employer’s server, in their institution’s repository, in a reference manager such as Mendeley, and on an author’s social
network. However, a number of conditions apply. For example, usually the manuscript must be a prepublication copy of the final
manuscript accepted for publication, not the final typeset version. Additionally, the posted prepublication copy of the manuscript
must carry a copyright notice and include a link to the final article on the publisher’s website using the article’s DOI. For articles
published in APA journals, use the following statement:

©  American  Psychological  Association,  [Year].  This  paper  is  not  the  copy  of  record  and  may  not  exactly  replicate  the  authoritative
document published in the APA journal. Please do not copy or cite without the author’s permission. The final article is available, upon
publication, at https://doi.org/[Article DOI]

APA’s guidelines for internet posting are available on the APA website (https://on.apa.org/2r7Eptq), along with general resources
and  FAQs  on  manuscript  postacceptance  procedures  and  dissemination  (https://on.apa.org/2KEBBgn).  If  your  article  is
published via an open access deposit policy, a version is also made available freely online (see Section 12.21).

382

12.24 Promoting Your Article
Authors are encouraged to promote their article after its publication. One way they may do so is to develop short summaries
describing  their  work  in  plain  language  and  share  these  along  with  the  article  DOI  through  their  social  media  networks.  A
journal may also ask for a public health significance statement or impact statement as part of the article; authors can use this
statement  as  a  foundation  for  communicating  their  work  and  its  broader  impact  to  the  public.  The  name  of  this  section  and
whether it is required depend on the journal, but the goal is to make the research more accessible to the public. Guidance on
writing  public  health  significance  or  impact  statements  can  be  found  on  the  APA  website  (https://on.apa.org/2DKj1lH).
Similarly, organizations or universities where the author is employed may ask for text to include in a press release to disseminate
key  findings  from  the  study.  These  materials  are  typically  brief,  so  make  sure  that  the  language  is  clear  and  that  findings  are
reported accurately and appropriately.

Communicating  your  research  in  plain  language  to  the  public  is  important  for  reaching  a  wide  array  of  readers  who  might
otherwise  be  unaware  of  your  work  and  its  potential  significance.  Many  publishers  offer  various  tools  to  assist  authors  in
promoting their work and tracking its impact. Advice on promoting your article, including how to work with the media, write
social  media  posts,  and  track  readership  of  your  article,  can  be  found  on  the  APA  website  (https://on.apa.org/2KEsnR6).  The
publication of your work represents a significant achievement, but in many ways publication is only the beginning of its impact
on the greater public.
