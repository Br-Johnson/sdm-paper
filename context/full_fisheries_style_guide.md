A Guide to AFS Publications Style

 American Fisheries Society
2016

Preface

The term “style” refers to the various editorial conventions that a publisher
follows. Many of these—notably the ones pertaining to grammar, spelling, punctuation,
and so forth—are common throughout the publishing world. Others—notably those
pertaining to reference formats and the treatment of technical terms—vary from publisher
to publisher. As a scientific publisher, the American Fisheries Society uses a highly
precise style that is designed both to facilitate communication within the fisheries
profession and to ensure the integrity of its publications.

This guide is intended to serve two different groups of users, namely, (1) authors

and (2) the copy editors and others responsible for putting manuscripts into final form. As
a result, not all of the information in the guide will be of interest to all users. For instance,
it includes sections on grammar and so forth that will be “old hat” to copy editors but that
may be useful to authors; in the same vein, it provides explanations of some basic
scientific concepts with which copy editors may be unfamiliar.

Every effort has been made to enable users to obtain the information they want
with a minimum of time and effort. The sections have been kept short, with numerous
headings; style points are presented in terms of simple rules; and the examples that are
given deal with situations that are encountered frequently. In many cases, it may be
possible to resolve a style question simply by looking at the examples.

To facilitate locating all of the information on a particular topic, a number of

cross-references are provided. There is also some intentional redundancy in the
presentation. For instance, the fact that gene names are italicized is noted both in the
chapter on symbols and in the chapter on the use of italics.

Although most of the guide is devoted to specific style points, the introduction

offers some general pointers on scientific writing that should be of value to both authors
and copy editors.

Given the vast number of style questions that can arise, no guide can really be

complete. For points that are not covered, users should contact the Journals Department
at 301-897-8616, extension 227, or journals@fisheries.org.

Finally, in the interest of making this guide as useful as possible and keeping it

up-to-date, users are encouraged to offer suggestions for future editions.

Introduction

Published articles are the permanent records of research efforts. They may be read
well beyond the author’s professional circle and even beyond his or her lifetime. For this
reason, among others, they must meet strict standards for both content and presentation.

The peer review process is designed to ensure that the papers published by the

American Fisheries Society (AFS) are relevant and scientifically sound, that is, that the
approach is acceptable and that the conclusions are reasonable in light of the evidence.

The editing process focuses primarily on presentation. Authors sometimes wonder

why editors are so strict, given that violations of the rules of composition seldom
interfere with the communication of ideas. There are two reasons. First, poor writing
places an additional burden on readers—it forces them to work out what the author means
rather than grasping it immediately. To take a simple example, suppose that an author
uses different terms for the same concept, say, “sampling sites” in some places and
“sampling locations” in others. Readers have to make the connection between the two
terms on their own, expending effort that would be better devoted to understanding the
substance of the paper. The second reason is that poor writing lessens the author’s
credibility. However subtly, errors such as faulty grammar cast doubt on the quality of
the underlying research; readers instinctively begin to question whether they can trust the
author on more substantive points.

This guide contains a wealth of information on the fundamental elements of
composition—grammar, spelling, punctuation, and so forth—as well as the ways in
which AFS publications treat technical terms and symbols. The first step in writing a
good paper is thus to become familiar with the material in this guide and to consult it as
needed during the writing process.

Over the years, the editorial staff have noticed that certain problems occur over
and over in papers submitted for publication, so it will be useful to highlight them here.
One overarching problem is a lack of formality—the use of slang, undefined acronyms,
abbreviated forms of expression, and so forth. Many authors, for instance, violate the
general rule on using the full common names for fish species at each mention, using, say,
“Chinook” for “Chinook Salmon.” (While AFS style permits the use of “salmon” or even
“fish” when the species is mentioned frequently [see section 9.4], it does not permit the
use of “Chinook” alone.) In the same vein, authors frequently use acronyms such as MSY
(maximum sustainable yield) without explanation. If such a term is used only once or
twice, it must be spelled out; if it is used more often, it must be spelled out the first time
but may then be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation is given the first time (see section
1.2).

Another overarching problem is the use of language that is not natural. Although
the use of technical terms is certainly acceptable, in other respects papers must be written

in ordinary English and not read like transcriptions of lab notes or seminar presentations.
One particularly egregious example is the omission of the words “the” and “that” when
the rules of grammar clearly require them. Consider the sentence

Fish we studied were age-0 hybrids.

In general, this sentence should be written

The fish that we studied were age-0 hybrids.

(see Chapter 14 for the exceptions to this rule). Additional examples of unnatural
language are given in the sections that follow.

So far, then, we have the following general rule: write naturally but with the

formality required of a scientific paper. We can flesh this rule out by noting that good
writing must fulfill three conditions: it must be correct, it must be clear, and it must be
reasonably smooth. Let us look at the three conditions in turn.

Correctness

From the standpoint of presentation, correctness means (1) adhering to the
accepted rules of composition and the particular elements of AFS style and (2) expressing
ideas accurately.

As noted above, much of this guide is devoted to helping you meet the first
objective. Let’s say that you are uncertain whether to write “main stem reaches” or
“main-stem reaches”; section 10.12 will show you that “main-stem” is the correct form
when the term is used as an adjective, as it is in this case. Similarly, section 2.9 will show
you that the first word in the term “upper Mississippi River” is not capitalized because it
is not part of a formal name.

One area in which authors frequently make errors is word choice. Take the classic

example, “that” versus “which.” Although the two terms can sometimes be used
interchangeably, at other times the distinction is crucial. For instance, the expression
“The fish that were moribund” implies that only some of the fish were moribund,
whereas the expression “The fish, which were moribund” implies that all of them were.
Other examples are given in Chapter 14 of this guide.

Authors are also frequently in doubt as to the correct treatment of technical terms

and symbols. For instance, should family names such as Ictaluridae be italicized? The
answer is no (see section 9.3). What is the accepted abbreviation for the dosage that is
lethal to 50% of the test animals? Appendix B shows that it is LD50 rather than LD50.

With respect to the second element of correctness, expressing ideas accurately,

consider the following example showing both the original and edited versions:

The variableconcerns about pH is primarily of concern because ofcenter on its effects on the
toxicity of other variables, such as the toxicity of ammonia toxicity and heavy metals toxicity.

There are two problems with the original version. First, variables per se cannot be

toxic; second, it refers to the toxicity of (ammonia and heavy metal) toxicity, which is
tautological.

Here is another example of inaccurate expression:

As lampreys lose body mass, the branchial basket appears to remain constant in size
compared with other body parts.

The original version is logically flawed because the size of the branchial basket

remains constant regardless of what happens to the other body parts.

A classic (and often comic) case of inaccurate expression is the dangling

participle. Here’s an example:

By hatching prematurely, the diffusion barrier created by the chorion and the water in the
perivitelline space disappears.

What the author meant was

When fish hatch prematurely, the diffusion barrier created by the chorion and the water in the
perivitelline space disappears.

The original literally states that the diffusion barrier hatches, which is not the case.

Clarity

A statement may lack clarity because its meaning is simply unclear or because it

is ambiguous (i.e., more than one interpretation is possible). Here is an example of simple
lack of clarity:

Each fish received an intraperitoneal injection with 0.1 mL of one of the two vaccines of the
vaccine Furogen 2 or 0.1 mL of sterile 0.9% NaCl (control). Control fish were vaccinated
with an injection of 0.1 mL of sterile 0.9% NaCl.

The original version fails to make clear that only one vaccine (Furogen 2) was

compared with NaCl (the control) and errs in calling the latter a vaccine.

Here is an example of ambiguity:

Blood was taken while fish were anesthetized by inserting heparinized needles into the caudal
vasculature while fish were anesthetized.

The original version is ambiguous because it is not clear whether the insertion of
heparinized needles into the caudal vasculature was for the purpose of anesthetizing the
fish or drawing blood from them.

Smoothness

There are several issues to consider in constructing smooth statements.

Awkwardness.—Awkward sentence structure crops up in virtually all types of writing.
Perhaps the best advice for avoiding it is to state your ideas as simply as possible.
Consider the following two examples:

Counts became lower as sampling moved to deeper water becausedue to the latter quadrants
werebeing less likely to have favorable substrate and therefore fewer red sea urchins.

There were only four instances in which Issues regarding transceivers detecteding, a
transponder’s code but displayed it incorrectly. displaying a transponder’s code were rare in
this study. In fact, the only instances in which tag codes were encountered (N = 4)All of these
involved AVID-encrypted transponders.

In the first example, only two simple changes are needed to eliminate the awkwardness.
In the second example, more extensive streamlining is required, including the transfer of
some information from the second sentence (in the original) to the first.

Verbosity.—Using more words than necessary to convey an idea is a common problem in
scientific writing. Consider a particularly bad example:

Fish that were vigorously chased showed significantly higher plasma cortisol levels than
control fish. Although the plasma cortisol levels of these alewives were significantly higher
than the levels of fish that did not experience vigorous chasing, the plasma glucose levels in
these alewives were not affected.

This can be streamlined to

Although the alewives that were vigorously chased had significantly higher plasma cortisol
levels than those that were not, they experienced no change in their plasma glucose levels.

Here’s a less egregious example:

Although our reasoning for drawing this conclusiondoes not completely match that ofthe
reasoning used by Smith (1970), we agree with Smith (1970)that the restoration of Great
Lakes fish communities will require further reductions in the number of alewives.

In this example, the phrases “for drawing this conclusion” and “with Smith (1970)” have
been deleted because they contribute nothing to the meaning of the sentence and the
phrase “the reasoning used by” has been changed to “that of” to avoid unnecessary
repetition.

As the last example suggests, one way to reduce verbosity is to use pronouns

(“that”) in place of nouns (“the reasoning”) whenever the meaning is clear. Despite the
widespread belief to the contrary, pronouns are perfectly acceptable in formal writing and
do much to improve it.

Another way to avoid verbosity is to use shortened forms of expression for

concepts that have already been stated in full:

The fish in zone 1 were the heaviest (130 ± 17 g [mean ± SD]), followed by those in zone 2
(125 ± 12 g[mean ± SD]) and then those in zone 3 (122 ± 13 g[mean ± SD]).

Since it is clear from the first mention that all of the values given are means ± SDs,
repetition of that information is not necessary.

Noun “sandwiches.”—Closely related to verbosity is the practice of piling up nouns one
after the other. Here’s a relatively inoffensive example:

This development would lessen the responses of theNorris Lake largemouth bass populations
responses in Norris Lake to the imposition of length limits.

In addition to being inelegant, noun sandwiches can obscure the key relationships
involved.

Lack of parallelism.—Parallelism means presenting similar information in a similar
fashion. Here’s an example:

Winter mMortality due to harvesting and other causes was lower in winter than in summer.

Apart from being awkward, the original leads readers to believe that the subject is winter
mortality rather than mortality per se, a misconception that is only corrected when they
have read the entire sentence.

Here’s another example:

We recorded the reactions of the rainbow trout but not those of the brown trout.

The addition of the words “those of” makes it clear that it is the reactions of the two
species that are the object of the sentence.

Unidiomatic expression.—Every language has its own particular conventions known as
“idioms.” For instance, in English one would say “English is the principal language of the
United States.” In French, however, one would say the equivalent of “The English is the
language principal of the United States.” Unidiomatic expression is surprisingly common
in scientific writing. Here’s a simple example:

 We designed the experiment to answeraddress this issue.

Alternatively, the sentence could have been rewritten as

We designed the experiment to answer this question.,

but the phrase “to answer this issue” may not be used because it is not idiomatic.

Here’s a more complicated example of unidiomatic expression that is also

somewhat awkward:

This stems from the direct role that causal relationshipthe growth factor plays in directly
regulating cellular proliferation.

The original is incorrect because growth factors play roles, not causal relationships.

1.  Abbreviations and Acronyms

This chapter presents the general principles governing the use of abbreviations and
acronyms. In addition, see sections 5.18–5.20 and 5.24 on units of measure and
Chapter 11 on symbols.

1.1  An abbreviation is a shortened form of a word or phrase:

Inc.   g   e.g.

An acronym is a word formed from the first letters of the words in a compound
term. Although acronyms often consist of all capital letters, they may consist  of
all lowercase letters or a combination:

AFS   ppm   mRNA

A list of abbreviations and acronyms that are used frequently in fisheries writing
appears in Appendix B.

SPELLING OUT

1.2  As a rule, do not introduce an abbreviation or acronym unless it is used at least three

times, and spell it out at first use:

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). . . .

Exceptions to the rule about spelling out at first use are abbreviations and acronyms
that

•  are listed as standard abbreviations and acronyms in an AFS journal or book

(see Appendix B)

•  have entries in Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (e.g., DNA)
•  have entries in the Merck Index (Merck & Co., Rahway, New Jersey)
•  are noted in sections 1.4–1.7

1.3

Once an abbreviation or acronym has been introduced, it should be used in lieu of
the full term except when the term occurs at the beginning of a sentence:

Food and Drug Administration regulations require that. . . .

not   FDA regulations require that. . . .

If necessary, rewrite the sentence to avoid beginning it with an acronym:

Analysis of the specimens’ DNA showed that. . . .

not   DNA analysis showed that. . . .

1.4

Certain stylistic abbreviations may be used:

e.g.   i.e.   etc.   et al.

Note that commas must follow the first two.

The following abbreviations pertaining to business entities are also permissible:

Co.   Corp.   Inc.   Ltd.

1.5

An author may be referred to by his or her initials in the acknowledgments, footnotes,
or text:

a grant to J.P.D.   (J.T.S., unpublished data)

Place Names and Addresses

1.6

The following abbreviations may be used in place names and addresses:

St. [Saint]   Ste. [Sainte]   Mt. [Mount]

D.C.   U.S. [as adjective]   USA [as noun]   UK [as noun or adjective]

1.7

The abbreviations NE, NW, SE, and SW (indicating sections of cities) and those
denoting ordinal numerals (“-st,” “-nd,” “-rd,” and “-th”) may be used in  addresses:

       1234 Massachusetts Avenue NW

Washington, D.C. 20007

719 East 42nd Street
New York, New York 10123

Note that “East,” “West,” “North,” and “South” must be spelled out.

1.8

Other elements of addresses must be spelled out:

Post Office Box 95
        Silver Spring, Maryland 20901

Note that except in authors’ addresses it is not necessary to include the country name
after U.S. and Mexican states and Canadian provinces.

USE WITH ARTICLES

1.9  When an acronym is read as a word, it is generally used without an article (“the,” “a,”

or “an”):

In this regard, ANOVA revealed that. . . .

When it is read as a series of letters, however, it is generally used with an article:

by means of a DBA [dot blot analysis]     the CTM [critical thermal maximum]

PLURALS

1.10  Abbreviations and acronyms should be considered singular and add an s to form the

plural unless they are units of measure or inherently plural:

environmental impact statements (EISs)  means and SDs

but  National Institutes of Health (NIH)

geographical information systems (GIS)

2.  Capitalization

PROPER NOUNS AND ADJECTIVES

2.1

Capitalize the names of organizations:

U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service

U.S. Government   but   Canadian government   federal government

2.2

Capitalize personal titles when they are used with the person’s name or alone:

Secretary of the Interior Smith

the Secretary of the Interior

2.3

Capitalize the formal names of programs:

the Chesapeake Bay Program   but   a habitat restoration program

2.4

Do not capitalize terms relating to general concepts, even when they include a
person’s name:

index of biotic integrity  Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient

2.5

Capitalize certain trade names:

Plexiglas   Styrofoam

but   formalin   petri dish

To determine which trade names to capitalize, consult Webster’s Third New
International Dictionary or the current edition of Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate
Dictionary.

Also capitalize the formal titles of software programs:

Restriction Enzyme Analysis Package

2.6

Capitalize the names of ships and aircraft:

RV Seth Gorden

Note that only the name per se is italicized.

Geographic and Geological Terms

Sections 2.7–2.14 present the general principles governing the capitalization of these
terms; a more detailed list is given in Appendix D. For geographic terms that are not
on that list, consult Webster’s New Geographical Dictionary.

1

POLITICAL DIVISIONS

2.7

Capitalize all words that are parts of formal names:

Washington State  but  state of Washington

Province of Ontario  but  Canadian provinces

TOPOGRAPHICAL AND PLACE NAMES

2.8

Capitalize all words that are parts of formal names:

Catskill Mountains   Colorado River  Midwest   North Atlantic   Pacific Northwest

2.9

Do not capitalize words that are purely descriptive:

Hudson River valley

Gulf coast of Texas  but  Gulf Coast [as region]

upper Mississippi River  but   Upper Peninsula [Michigan]

2.10  Capitalize popular names:

Deep South

Eastern Shore [Maryland]

but  the eastern shore of Hudson Bay

West Coast [U.S.]

but  the western coast of Florida

2.11  Certain structures and defined areas should be capitalized:

Grand Coulee Dam

Lock 19   Pool 12  [Mississippi River]

1

For several reasons, geographic terms sometimes have variant spellings. As far as possible, use the variants that
are appropriate to American English, e.g., “Mexico” rather than the Spanish “México” (although the latter should
be used in addresses and names of organizations in Spanish).

2.12  Do not capitalize generic terms used in the plural when they follow specific

terms:

Rappahannock and Rapidan rivers   but   Lakes Erie and Ontario

Note that generic terms that are not used in the plural are capitalized even when
they are part of compound expressions:

Rappahannock and Rapidan River floods

2.13     Do not capitalize shortened names:

the bay [referring to the previously named Chesapeake Bay]

GEOLOGICAL TERMS

2.14  With the exception noted in section 2.9, capitalize all parts of such terms:

Wisconsin Glaciation   Burgess Shale

Appalachian Highlands   Piedmont Province   Tennessee Section

Upper Pennsylvanian   Late Oligocene

Taxonomic Names

2.15  Capitalize all portions of the common names of fish species and subspecies but not

those of hybrids and life history variants:

Largemouth Bass   Lahontan Cutthroat Trout

but   saugeye   steelhead

Capitalize the names of genera but not those of specific epithets:

Oncorhynchus spp.   Ictalurus punctatus

           Salmoniformes

Proper Adjectives

2.16  Capitalize adjectives derived from proper nouns:

Mendelian  North American

OTHER USES

2.17  Capitalize terms such as “table,” “figure,” and “chapter” when they refer to specific

items. Also capitalize terms such as “methods” and “results” when  they  refer to
sections of a paper:

Table 1   Figure 2   Chapters 5–7

For additional details, see Methods.   As noted in Results, . . .

Do not capitalize other identifying labels:

experiment 2   tank 3

2.18     Capitalize compass directions:

N   ENE   10°6′N, 8°37′W

Note that latitude and longitude coordinates are separated by a comma and a space
but that there are no spaces within the coordinates themselves.

3.  Italics

3.1

Genus and species names should be italicized, but not those at other taxonomic
levels:

Acipenser spp.   Esox lucius

but   Ictaluridae   Salmoniformes

3.2

Single-letter mathematical and statistical terms should be italicized unless they
are Greek letters:

2
Lt   L1   r

   F-value   P = 0.05
but   ß  ∆

Multiple-letter terms may be italicized or not, provided that the treatment is
consistent throughout the paper.

3.3

All elements of gene and allele designations (but not those for the enzymes
for which they code) should be italicized:

mAAT*   EST-1*   *150   GPI-A*1/2

Note that the asterisks in these terms are italicized as well.

All elements of microsatellite designations except Greek letters should be
italicized:

Ssa85   Oneµ3

3.4

Certain other technical terms and abbreviations should be italicized:

Taq [a restriction enzyme]   chlorophyll a   g [gravity]   F [fishing mortality]

See Chapter 11 and Appendix B for other such terms and abbreviations.

3.5

The names of ships and aircraft should be italicized (but not type designators
such  as “USS” and “RV”):

RV [research vessel] Seth Gorden

3.6  Non-English words should be italicized:

In French, the brook trout is known as the omble de fontaine.

However, words of non-English origin that have been incorporated into English
should not be italicized:

barranca   thalweg   in vitro

All of the words in the main section of Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary
should be treated as English words; those in the section called “Foreign Words &
Phrases” should be treated as non-English words.

3.7

Italics may be used for emphasis provided that the use is sparing:

However, we observed this in small streams too. [i.e., where it was not expected]

3.8  Words used as words should be put in quotation marks rather than italics:

In this context, the term “recruitment” means. . . .

However, letters used as letters are generally italicized:

The letter X marks the location of the study site.

but   U-shaped valley

4.  Mathematics and Statistics

SYMBOLS

4.1

All mathematical symbols consisting of single letters from the Latin alphabet
should be italicized; the same is true for the vast majority of statistical
symbols. Greek letters, however, should be in ordinary type. Multiple-letter
terms may be italicized or not provided that the treatment is consistent:

2
z   s

   Wr   y = f(x)   t-test

β  Linit

CPUEt   or   CPUEt

Note that subscripts and superscripts are treated as separate symbols for this
purpose; that is, a subscript or superscript consisting of a single letter should
be italicized even if the main symbol is not, and conversely.

See Appendix A for the treatment of specific mathematical and statistical
terms.

4.2

If punctuation follows a superscripted term, it should come after the
superscript:

2
. . . a higher value of R

, which implies . . .

LOGARITHMS

4.3

Logarithms are generally denoted by the abbreviation “log” with a subscript
indicating the base (usually e or 10):

loge   log10

Note that e is italicized.

In the case of natural logarithms, however, “ln” may be used instead of “loge.”

4.4

As a rule, there should be no space between the terms “loge” (or “ln”) and
“log10” and the variables and coefficients with which they appear:

1.23logex

However, if the resulting expression is awkward, spaces, center dots, and
parentheses may be used for clarity:

7.81 logex   7.81∙logex   1.23loge(TL)

4.5  When the term “log” is used as a prefix, it is usually followed by a hyphen:

log-likelihood function   log-linear model   log-transformed data

but   lognormal(ity)   The data were log transformed.

However, nouns and adjectives involving “loge” (or “ln”) and “log10” are not
hyphenated:

log10 transformation   loge transformed data

VECTORS AND MATRICES

4.6  Vectors and matrices should be in bold type:

x   U

The operators in cross products (which are indicated by times signs and
result in vectors) and dot products (which are indicated by center dots and
result in single numbers [scalars]) should also be in bold type:

w × y    z · x

EQUATIONS

Formatting

4.7

The goal in formatting equations is to present them in a readily understandable
way. Two guidelines that are useful in this regard are (1) to break lines before
an operator, preferably a plus or minus sign and (2) to use spacing, parentheses
and their equivalents, and (in the case of multiplicative terms) center dots or
times signs to group terms logically:

loge(Nt+1) = loge(α) + loge(Nt)
                    – loge[1 + (Nt/γ)]β

4.8

Variable definitions may either be run into the text or presented in a list. There
are two formatting options when they are run into the text:

dN/dt = rN⋅[(K – N)/K],

where N is the population at any given time, r is the rate of population increase, and
K  is the carrying capacity of the environment.

or

where N = the population at any given time, r = the rate of population increase, and
K = the carrying capacity of the environment.

A list is preferable when there are numerous terms or they appear in more
than one equation:

C = (Mr + Ma + SDA) + (F + U) + (Gs + Gr),

where

C   = the rate of energy consumption
Mr = the standard metabolic rate
Ma = the increase in metabolic rate due to activity
. . . .

Copyeditors should note that in the list (1) variable definitions should begin
one em dash from the margin, (2) the equals signs should be aligned, and (3)
any overflow should be hang-indented to the right of the equals sign.

4.9

In mathematical expressions, the sequence { [ (  ) ] } should be used for
grouping terms:

t = [(x1 – x2) – D0]/{s[(1/n1) + (1/n2)]

1/2

}

(The reverse sequence is used in ordinary text.)

Text References

4.10  Numbered equations should be referred to in the text as follows:

equation (1)   equations (2) and (3)   equations (2)–(5)

When the reference itself appears within parentheses, the parentheses around
the equation number should be omitted:

The most reliable estimates (from equation 7) . . .

STATISTICS

4.11  Simple summary statistics (means, ranges, and standard deviations [SDs]

or errors [SEs]) may be reported in any of several ways:

(mean, 45.2 mm)   (mean = 45.2 mm)   not   (mean 45.2)

                      (mean, 45.2 mm; SD, 3.84)  or  (mean = 45.2 mm; SD = 3.84)
or  45.2 ± 3.84 (mean ± SD)

Whichever form is used must be used consistently, however. Avoid using
expressions such as

The mean total length was 45.2 ± 3.84 mm.

because they are inaccurate (the mean was 45.2 mm, not 45.2 ± 3.84 mm).

Note that the term “coefficient of variation” must be defined as the
percentage ratio of the standard deviation (or error) to the mean:

The coefficient of variation (100⋅SD/mean) was. . . .

4.12  The results of statistical tests should be reported by giving the test statistic

(and, if it is not obvious, the type of test), the degrees of freedom, and the P-
value in the following format:

. . . were significantly different (χ2

 = 13.91, df = 26, P < 0.001)

. . . were not different (ANOVA: F = 0.93; df = 4, 22; P = 0.46)

The degrees of freedom for F-statistics may also be presented as subscripts:

. . . (ANOVA: F4, 22 = 0.93, P = 0.46)

Note that there should be a space after the comma separating the degrees of
freedom for the numerator from the degrees of freedom for the denominator
regardless of the number of digits.

4.13  As a rule, it is preferable to report individual P-values for all significant

results. However, when a paper contains a large number of statistical results
and distinguishing between the degrees of significance is not important, a
general significance level may be reported instead:

Values were considered significant at α < 0.05.

P-values should not be given in abstracts or in conjunction with references to
results in cited works:

Smith (1998) found a significant correlation between. . . .

NOTE ON THE GENERAL LINEAR MODEL1

4.14  The term “general linear model” encompasses several statistical methods,

including linear regression, analysis of variance, and analysis of covariance,
in which the errors are distributed normally.2 For this reason, merely alluding
to the general linear model does not provide an adequate description of the
analyses performed. In particular, it is important to indicate (1) whether the
analysis incorporates random as well as fixed effects and (2) whether the
variables are continuous or categorical.

A fixed-effects analysis focuses on the particular factor levels or blocks included in
the analysis (e.g., the relative abundance of fish in a particular set of streams, where
stream is treated as a block), while controlling for other factors. By contrast, a
“mixed” analysis includes both fixed and random effects by treating the blocks as
being randomly selected from the set of all possible blocks (e.g., treating the sampled
streams as a representative subsample of all the streams in the region of interest),
again controlling for other factors.

A variable is said to be “continuous” when the data are ungrouped (e.g., fish
weights), “categorical” when they are grouped (e.g., male vs. female or treated vs.
untreated). An analysis with continuous variables gives insights into overall patterns
(e.g., a regression trend); an analysis with categorical variables gives insights into
differences among groups.

Note that some variables, such as fish age or year of sampling, may be treated as
either continuous or categorical depending on the hypothesis in which one is
interested, thus emphasizing the need to specify exactly how the general linear model
was constructed. However the analysis is presented, the overall goal is to give
readers enough information to replicate the procedure.

1 The Publications Department thanks Daniel Hayes for his contributions to this section.
2 The general linear model is thus different from the generalized linear model, which can accommodate
nonnormally distributed errors.

5.  Numbers and Measurements

NUMBERS

Word or Numeral?

5.1

As a general rule, spell out numbers less than 10 unless they are used with units of
measure:

four anglers  12 boats

4 cm

7 weeks

Note that counts (e.g., numbers of fish) are not considered measurements:

six white bass   not   6 white bass

EXCEPTIONS

5.2

Always spell out numbers at the beginning of a sentence; if they are used with
units of measure, spell out those units as well:

Twelve repetitions were. . . .     Ninety-five days later, . . .

5.3

Spell out numbers less than 10 that are used with units of measure (as well as the
units of measure) when there are intervening words:

five abnormally cold days     seven or more centimeters

5.4

Spell out numbers less than 100 when they modify a compound adjective that
contains a number:

ten 30-cm fish   but   105 30-cm fish

5.5

Use numerals for all numbers that apply to the same or similar items when any of
those numbers are greater than nine and they occur in close proximity to one another:

4 rainbow trout and 12 striped bass

from 5 to 20 anglers

2–20 ponds

5.6

Use numerals for numbers used as numbers or designating items in a sequence:

The index ranges from 1 to 5.  Outcomes were coded 0 or 1.

experiment 2

tank 3

Precision

5.7

Give the same number of digits for numbers stemming from the same set of
measurements or calculations:

Numbers with Many Digits

5.73–6.10 cm   not   5.73–6.1 cm

5.8

Use commas in numbers with four or more digits:

5.9

Use scientific notation for very large or small numbers:

1,234    56,789.12

3.4 × 10

6  1.94 × 10

–3

Note that it is acceptable to use the word “million” in a number (e.g., 3.4 million
instead of 3.4 × 106). Avoid using the words “billion” and “trillion,” however,
because they have different meanings in different countries (e.g., 1 billion is 109 in
the United States but 1012 in the United Kingdom).

Decimals

5.10     Place a zero before the decimal point in decimal numbers less than 1.00:

0.05   not   .05

Fractions

5.11     In text, spell out fractions:

one-third     three fifty-fifths     forty-two hundredths

Ordinal Numbers

5.12  Treat ordinal numbers the same as cardinal numbers, but spell out units of

measure:

third day     fifth hour     22nd day     15th repetition
every 10th meter     third-order stream

Use the abbreviations “st,” “nd,” “rd,” and “th” to denote ordinal numbers; these
should be on the same line as the numeral:

11th   not   11

th

Dates and Time

5.13  The U.S. convention should be used for dates:

March 29, 2002   not   29 March 2002

Note that in text a comma follows the year:

August 11, 1999, was the peak day for mortality.

Commas should not be used when only the month and year are given:

June 2001   not   June, 2001

5.14  Time should always be given in terms of the 24-hour clock:

0800 hours   1545 hours

  Note that the plural “hours” is always used and that it is never abbreviated:

0030 hours   not   0030 hour   or   0030 h

MEASUREMENTS

English or Metric Units?

5.15  The term “metric units” refers to the units of measure included in the International

System of Units established in 1960.

Metric units must be used in AFS books and Fisheries as well as in Transactions of
the American Fisheries Society, the Journal of Aquatic Animal Health, and Marine
and Coastal Fisheries: Dynamics, Management, and Ecosystem Science. Either
English or metric units may be used in the North American Journal of Fisheries
Management and the North American Journal of Aquaculture as long as one set of
units is used consistently.

A list of acceptable units is given on the page entitled “Symbols and Abbreviations”
in the back of each journal as well as in Appendix B.

EXCEPTIONS

5.16  English units may be used in lieu of metric units when the English measure is the one
most commonly used, as is frequently the case with construction materials and some
pieces of equipment. To the extent that it is practical, provide a metric equivalent or
conversion factor:

¼-in (0.635-cm) screw   100 hp (1 hp = 746 W)

5.17  Units may be mixed when this is the common practice:

grams of medication per pound of feed (g/lb)

Abbreviations

5.18

In text, units of measure are generally abbreviated (unless there is no
abbreviation) when preceded by a number and spelled out otherwise:

3 km   but   a few kilometers
7 g   but   measured in grams

Lists of acceptable abbreviations appear at the back of each journal and at the front
of all symposium proceedings. See Chapter 1 for more details.

The following units are always spelled out:

acre   ton   year   month   week

Note that there are no separate plural forms for abbreviated units of measure:

1 km   8 km

5.19  Units of measure that stand alone may be abbreviated when they appear in

parenthetical expressions:

Fish were weighed (g). . . .
but   Fish were weighed to the nearest gram. . . .

5.20  Avoid mixing words and abbreviations:

six boats per day   or   6 boats/d

not

six boats/d   six boats per d   or   6 boats per day

Note that “6 boats/d” is acceptable even though the first term would ordinarily be
expressed as “six boats.”

Operators

5.21  Operators such as =, >, and < may be used in straight text as well as in parenthetical

expressions:

Fish weighed 2.9 ± 0.35 kg.

Values were deemed significant at α ≤ 0.05.

Trophy length fish (>380 mm). . . .

Space is required around operators when the term in parentheses expresses a
complete thought:

(length ≤ 10 cm)   but   length (≤10 cm)

Sequences and Ranges

5.22  The unit of measure should be given only once if the measurement is written with a

space between the number and the unit of measure:

from 6 to 10 mm in length   5, 6, or 7 mm in length

If the measurement is written with no space between the number and the unit of
measure, the unit should be repeated when there are only two measurements but
given only once when there are three or more:

between 2% and 4%   but   5, 6, and 7%, respectively

5.23  Ranges may be expressed in any of the following ways:

from 72 to 84 s   between 72 and 84 s   72–84 s

not   from 72–84 s

Note that the rule for repeating units of measure is analogous to that in section
5.22:

between 10°C and 12°C   but   10–12°C

Monetary Values

5.24     Indicate the national currency the first time a monetary value is given:

US$50,000   Can$25,000

Consult the current edition of Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary for other
currencies and their abbreviations.

Ratios

5.25  Certain ratios are expressed by a colon:

(1:3, male : female)   12 h light : 12 h dark

strontium : calcium   Sr:Ca

Note that there should be spaces around the colon when it is either preceded or
followed by a whole word.

5.26     More commonly, ratios are expressed by forward slashes:

4.29 mg/L

When there is more than one term in the denominator, negative exponents should be
used instead of forward slashes:

15 g⋅m

–2⋅d

–1

To prevent an expression from becoming unwieldy, it may be preferable to
rewrite it:

2
15 g/m

 daily

Concentrations

5.27  At first mention, concentrations should be stated precisely:

                               1 µg of gentamicin/mL of water

However, if there is no possibility of misunderstanding, the shortened form

1 µg/mL gentamicin

may be used instead. After the first mention, the still more concise form

may be used.

1 µg/mL

A similar rule applies to the use of the term “solution”:

in a 10% solution of formalin

should be used at first mention and

       in 10% formalin

thereafter.

5.28  When metric units are required, parts per thousand, parts per million, and parts per

billion should be expressed as in the following table, depending on whether the
concentration refers to weight per unit of volume, weight per unit of weight, or
volume per unit of volume (note that 1 L of water weighs 1 kg):

Concentration

Weight : volume  Weight : weight

Parts per thousand
Parts per million
Parts per billion

g/L (mg/mL)
mg/L (µg/mL)
µg/L (ng/mL)

g/kg (mg/g)
mg/kg (µg/g)
µg/kg (ng/g)

Volume :
volume
mL/L (µL/mL)
µL/L (nL/mL)
nL/L (pL/mL)

5.29  Salinity is usually expressed either as parts per thousand (i.e., grams per liter of

water) or as the ratio of the conductivity of the water in question to that of a standard
potassium chloride solution. The latter is known as the practical salinity scale and has
no units. When salinity is expressed as parts per thousand, the per mille symbol (‰)
should be used:

Seawater has a salinity of 30–33‰.

When it is expressed in terms of the practical salinity scale, authors should note that
fact. Alternatively, they may indicate that salinity is given in “practical salinity units”
or psu.

5.30  Blood volumes, which are usually measured in cubic centimeters (cc), should be

expressed in milliliters (1 cc = 1 mL); deciliters (1 dL = 10 mL) are also acceptable.

River Kilometers

5.31  Locations along a river are usually stated in terms of the number of river

kilometers from a given point:

At river kilometer (rkm [or RKM]) 95 of the Ohio River (measuring from its confluence with the
Mississippi River), . . .

Note that the term “river kilometer” must be spelled out at first mention and that the
“origin” (i.e., the 0-rkm point) must be stated.

Distance traveled along a river should be stated in terms of kilometers alone:

We moved 4 km upriver [e.g., from rkm 95 to rkm 99] to the next sampling site.

Geographic Coordinates

5.32  Geographic coordinates may be expressed either in the conventional degrees–

minutes–seconds format or as decimal degrees:

45°50′28.9386″N, 121°56′43.6668″W

or

45.841372°, –121.945463°

Note that compass directions (N, W, etc.) are not used with decimal degrees.

The precision with which geographic coordinates are reported should be determined
by their purpose, i.e., how much detail the reader requires.

6.  Punctuation

By and large, AFS publications follow the Chicago Manual of Style in matters of
punctuation. In addition to noting basic rules of punctuation, this chapter highlights
(1) areas in which AFS style differs from that in the Chicago Manual and (2)
situations that are apt to cause difficulty for authors.

PUNCTUATION MARKS

Colons

6.1  When emphasis is desired, a colon may be used to introduce a secondary clause

that is closely related to the main clause:

This approach often leads to a serious problem: noncomparable data.

The results are quite clear: recruitment is a function of stream temperature.

Note that the secondary clause need not be complete and that the first word is not
capitalized even when the clause is complete.

6.2

A colon may also be used to introduce a list, provided that it does not come between
a verb and its object(s) or after an expression like “such as” and “namely”:

The following treatments were administered: x, y, and z.

The treatments were x, y, and z.   not   The treatments were: x, y, and z.

Certain substrates were preferred: sand, gravel, and cobble.

but   Certain substrates were preferred, namely, sand, gravel, and

cobble.

6.3

In scientific papers, colons are often used to indicate ratios (see section 5.25):

strontium : calcium   Sr:Ca   1:1
12 h light : 12 h dark

Commas

6.4

Commas should be used after each item in a series of three or more items:

egg, alevin, and fry stages   not   egg, alevin and fry stages

6.5  With the exception noted in section 6.7, commas should be used after long

introductory phrases:

After an acclimation period of 72 h, the fish. . . .

They may be omitted after short introductory phrases, however:

One week later the fish. . . .

By 1999 the situation had changed.

6.6  With the exception noted in section 6.7, commas should be used to separate

independent clauses that are joined by the words “and,” “but,” “for,” “or,” “so,”
and “yet”:

Previous research suggested that survival was density dependent, and our findings strongly
support that conclusion.

Commas should not be used when one clause shares its subject with another
clause:

We collected additional data and performed an analysis of variance on the expanded data set.

6.7

Commas should not be used after introductory phrases that are associated with the
second independent clause in a compound sentence or to separate independent
clauses with a common introductory phrase:

Specimens were obtained by gill netting, and although the samples were not as large as expected
they were adequate for our purposes.

At the laboratory, DNA samples were extracted from the fish and electrophoresis was
performed to determine whether the populations were genetically distinct.

6.8

Semicolons should be used instead of commas to separate independent clauses
that are joined by one of the following adverbs:

also
finally
incidentally
meanwhile
otherwise
thus

anyway
furthermore
indeed
moreover
still

besides
hence
instead
nevertheless
then

consequently
however
likewise
next
therefore

Tests showed no significant differences between groups 1 and 2; therefore, these groups were pooled
in subsequent analyses.

Commas may be used with appositives (i.e., two terms referring to the same thing)

6.9
and material of a parenthetical nature:

The dependent variable, yt, was defined as. . . .

The study area, which comprises all or part of three administrative districts, . . .

In some cases, however, it may be preferable to put such material within
parentheses per se.

Ellipses (Sequences of dots)

6.10     Ellipses are used to indicate omissions in quotations:

“Fisheries management draws on bioenergetics, genetics, . . ., and other specialties.”
“This finding was considered definitive. . . .”

Note that the dots are separated by spaces and that four dots are used when the
omission occurs at the end of a sentence.

Em and En Dashes

6.11  Dashes of two different lengths serve different purposes in formal writing. The

longer ones, which are called em dashes, are used to emphasize material of a
parenthetical nature:

Determining the toxicity to fish—the principal goal of the experiment—was problematical.

6.12  The shorter ones, which are called en dashes, are mainly used to indicate a

range of numbers or other sequential items:

6–10 mm   May–July 1996

Note, however, that hyphens are used with nonsequential numbers:

Project 83-465

6.13

In AFS publications, en dashes are also used as a replacement for “and,” “to,” and
“at” in compounds:

Beverton–Holt   length–weight relationship   University of Wisconsin–Madison

Hyphens should be used in compounds not involving “and,” “to,” or “at”:

length-frequency analysis [i.e., of the frequency distribution of lengths]

Smith-Root [compound legal name]

Forward Slashes

6.14

In ordinary text (as opposed to mathematical expressions and special symbols), a
forward slash is equivalent to the word “or.” It may be used in this sense in AFS
publications:

                 morbidity/mortality

It should never be used as a substitute for the word “and,” however:

lakes and rivers   not   lakes/rivers

Hyphens

6.15  Hyphens are used primarily in (1) compound words, (2) compound names, (3)

grant and project numbers, and (4) chemical names:

gill-net fishery   clear-cut areas   P-value

Cavalli-Sforza

grant GB-6708   Project FWS-97-12

glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase   2,4-D

See Chapter 10 and Appendix A for additional information on the use of hyphens in
compound words; see sections 6.12–6.13 for situations in which en dashes are used
instead of hyphens.

Parentheses

6.16  Parentheses may be used to provide subsidiary information or indicate the

equivalence between terms:

Our goal (in addition to bringing the existing time series up to date) was to obtain more
detailed data on Striped Bass.

Fish without this genetic marker (hereafter, “strays”). . . .

Parentheses are particularly useful in long or complex sentences.

Semicolons

6.17  The most common use of semicolons is to connect closely related clauses:

The finding of . . . was highly unusual; as a result, we. . . .

See section 6.8 for additional information on this use of the semicolon.

6.18  Semicolons may also be used to separate items in a list when the items are numerous

or contain commas:

We obtained fish samples from the following reaches (indicated by river kilometers): 67–73,
which is free-flowing; 47–51, which is impounded by the dam; and 6–11, which is largely
regulated by dam operations.

6.19

In AFS publications, semicolons are also used to separate citations and to separate
closely related items from others within parentheses:

(Smith 1999; Thompson 2001)

(F1, 29 = 7.98, P = 0.034; Table 1)

USE WITH QUOTATION MARKS, ITALICS, AND BOLDFACE

6.20

In expressions involving quotation marks, periods and commas are always placed
inside the quotation marks and colons and semicolons are always placed outside of
them. Dashes, question marks, and exclamation points are placed inside the quotation
marks when they are part of the quoted material and outside when they apply to the
entire sentence (see the examples in section 7.4)

6.21  Punctuation marks should be in ordinary type even when they come immediately

after terms in italic or boldface type:

. . . populations of rainbow trout O. mykiss, which. . . .

. . . the variance–covariance matrix X'X–1.

LISTS

Lists of the variables in a mathematical expression are dealt with in section 4.8.

Other lists may either be run into the text or set off from it in one or more columns. In
either format, the items must be grammatically the same (e.g., all nouns, verbal
phrases, complete sentences, and so forth). The items may be numbered or bulleted if
this facilitates comprehension, but letters may not be used.

6.22  A run-in list forms a natural part of a sentence:

The study had three goals: (1) to determine overall species richness in the lower portion of the
river, (2) to determine the distribution of individual species by habitat type, and (3) to identify any
changes in species richness and distribution since the construction of the dam.

Run-in lists are most appropriate when the number of items is small. If numbers are
used, they should be enclosed in parentheses; semicolons may be substituted for
commas when there are commas within the items themselves (see section 6.18).

6.23  A column (or vertical) list is introduced by a complete clause and generally followed
by a colon. The format of the list itself varies according to the length and complexity
of the items in it. Simple lists require no numbering or punctuation:

The student volunteers were asked to bring the following:

rain gear
insect repellent
a change of clothing
. . .

Note the blank line after the lead-in.

More complex lists should be numbered or bulleted:

Four management recommendations emerge from this study:

1. Increasing the minimum length limit
2. Shortening the fishing season
 . . .

The following lakes are characterized by extreme acidification:

•  Beaver
•  Williams
•  White Rock
. . .

Numbers are preferable if the number or sequence of the items is important. Note that
numbers are followed by periods and that the first letter of each item in the list is
capitalized.

If the items in a vertical list are an integral part of the sentence, they should be
separated by semicolons with a period after the last one:

The procedure consists of

1. sampling the entire length of the creek right after ice-out;
2. sampling the shallower portions during the spring spawning season; and
3. sampling the deeper portions in late summer.

Note that in this case the first letter of each item is not capitalized.

7.  Quotations

FORMAT

7.1

Quotations of three printed lines or less should be placed directly in the text and
indicated by double quotation marks:

Smith (2000) found “a significant degree of hybridization” among the fish at this
location.

7.2

Quotations of more than three printed lines should be set as block quotations that are
separated from the text (copy editors should identify them as block quotations and
mark them to be indented and set in smaller type [e.g., 8/9.5 when the text is 9/11]):

Thompson et al. (1999:57) reported that

[t]he incidence of parasitic infection was significantly (P < 0.05) greater in Brown Bullheads
Ameiurus nebulosus from Hopkins Pond than in those from the Schuylkill River. However, the
relationship between pollution and parasitic infection was unclear in the small samples that were
taken.

Page numbers (57 in the above example) may be given as an aid to readers but are not
required.

Note that such quotations are “run into” the text and punctuated accordingly.

Citations for block quotations may also be put in brackets at the end; see section
8.10 for an example.

PUNCTUATION

7.3

7.4

Place periods and commas inside quotation marks, colons and semicolons outside.

Place dashes, question marks, and exclamation points inside quotation marks
when they are part of the quoted material, outside when they apply to the entire
sentence:

Many researchers have asked the question, “How do we proceed in the face of such
uncertainties?”

How should fisheries biologists “sample efficiently”?

Note that no period is necessary in the first example.

SPECIAL USAGE OF WORDS

7.5  Words used as words or in an unusual context may be put within double quotation

marks (not italics or single quotation marks):

The term “eutrophic” generally refers to waters with excess nutrients.

  These XX “males” were then allowed to breed with normal females.

When a word is used in an unusual context, it should only be put within quotation
marks the first time it occurs.

8.  References

8.1

AFS publications use the author–date system for references, with brief parenthetical
citations in the text and full references in an alphabetical list at the end:

  Text:

. . . similar findings (Gorman and Karr 1978).

Mills (1989) states that. . . .

  Reference list:

Gorman, O. T., and J. R. Karr. 1978. Habitat structure and stream fish
communities. Ecology 59:507–515.

Mills, D. H. 1989. Ecology and management of Atlantic Salmon. Chapman
and Hall, London.

If there are two authors, the last names of both of them should be included in the text
citation; if there are more than two, include the last name of the first author followed
by “et al.”

CITATIONS IN TEXT

Arrangement

8.2  When there is more than one citation for a particular statement, list them (1)

chronologically, beginning with the oldest (with “in press” and “unpublished”
sources at the end), and then (2) alphabetically within years (with citations
containing “and” and “et al.” in alphabetical order):

(Roberts 1985; Johnson 1987; Berger, in press)
(Eldridge 1989; Smith 1992; Smith and Thomas 1992)

Exception: Group publications by the same author or authors together, even if this
violates the rule about chronological listing:

(Roberts 1992, 1997; Smith 1996)

8.3

Use lowercase letters to distinguish multiple publications by an author or authors in
the same year:

(Hansen et al.1997a, 1997b)

See section 8.48 for the order in which such publications should appear in the
reference list and the assignment of lowercase letters to them.

Special Situations

ABSTRACTS

8.4

Abstracts of papers presented at meetings are not acceptable as references in AFS
publications. Such material should be treated as unpublished (see sections 8.13–
8.17).

NO DATE

8.5

Publications for which no date is available should be listed before those that are in
press:

(Harrison 1987; Stein, no date; Bailey, in press)

REFERENCE NOT SEEN

8.6  When the author has not actually seen the source in question, this must be

indicated:

PAGE NUMBERS

(Berzins 1960, cited by Grande et al. 1978)

8.7

Page numbers may be included in a citation when the material referred to would
otherwise be hard to locate:

PAPERS IN THE SAME ISSUE OR BOOK

(Zar 1984:286–291)

8.8  When a cited paper is in the same book or issue of a journal as the one citing it,

this should be indicated:

(Robson 1991, this volume)   (Li and Moyle 1991, this issue)
(Miller and Drake 1991; Smith 1991; both this issue)

PARENTHETICAL MATERIAL

8.9  Additional text may be included with citations:

(see Hayes et al. 2000 for a review)
(e.g., Moseley 1999)

However, care must be taken not to confuse results from the cited source with
those from the present paper:

(Table 3 [in present paper]; Williams 1990)   but   (Table 3 in Williams 1990)

. . . in many salmonid diseases (e.g., whirling disease: Carroll 1998)

The colon in the second example makes it clear that it was Carroll who studied
whirling disease rather than the author of the present paper.

BLOCK QUOTATIONS

8.10  The citation for a block quotation may be given either in the text (see section 7.2) or

in brackets following the quotation:

. . . when the salmon are out of season and unfit for use. [From Thwaits 1904.]

TABLE AND FIGURE CAPTIONS

8.11  Citations may appear in table and figure captions with additional text as

necessary:

FIGURE 1.—Proportional stock densities for Largemouth Bass. (Source: Lehman et al. 1987.)

TABLE 1.—Length frequency distributions for principal species at Spirit Lake. (Adapted from
Klein 1996.)

SERIES OF REFERENCES WITH THE SAME TITLE

8.12  A series of reports or articles with essentially the same title but different years of

publication may be combined in citations and reference lists:

Text:

(USGS 1966–1984)

UNPUBLISHED MATERIAL

8.13

If the source is either the single author of the present paper or all of several
authors, unpublished material may be cited in any of the following ways:

 (my [our] unpublished data)   (author’s [authors’] unpublished data)

(author [authors], unpublished data [on file])

Note that the same format is used for the first mention and any subsequent ones.

8.14

If the source is one of several authors of the present paper, the permissible
formats are as follows:

First mention:

(Carl B. [or C. B.] Schreck, unpublished)
unpublished data collected by one of us (C.B.S.)

ams 1986, and unpublished)

Subsequent mentions:

(Schreck, unpublished)   (C.B.S., unpublished)

There are a couple of things to note about such citations: (1) when only the
author’s initials are given, they should be closed up; and (2) in citations like
“(Adams 1986, and unpublished)” it is not necessary to include the author’s last
name or initials before the word “unpublished” but the word “and” is needed to
make it clear that there are two citations (one published and one not).

8.15

If the source is not an author of the present paper, the person’s affiliation must be
given at first mention:

(J. Magnuson, University of Wisconsin, personal communication)

(L. A. Smith, Washington Department of Fisheries, unpublished data)

(J. Hawks, University of Kansas, and N. Lyons, Pennsylvania State University,

personal communication[s])

8.16

If the source consists of fewer than four people, all of them should be named;
otherwise only the first should be named, with a descriptive reference to the others:

(V. Ross, B. Reed, and C. Rolls, University of Virginia, unpublished data) [fewer than four people]

but

        (V. Ross and coworkers, University of Virginia, unpublished data)   [four or more people]

8.17  Memoranda, internal reports, papers presented at meetings, and similar

unpublished material should be cited as follows:

First mention:

(A. H. Townsend, 1983 memorandum to B. H. Baker, Alaska Department of
Fish and Game, on sportfishing and placer mining)

Data of S. L. Abidi (paper read at the American Chemical Society meeting,
1980)

Subsequent mentions:

REFERENCE LISTS

8.18  References should be listed alphabetically by authors’ last names. If there is more
than one reference with the same authors, those references should be listed
chronologically.

Smith, R. C. 1992. Spawning patterns in. . . .

Smith, R. C., J. B. Oldham, and W. F. Stone. 1998. Determinants of. . . .

Smith, R. C., and H. Thompson. 1995. Observations on. . . .

Smith, R. C., and H. Thompson. 1997. Additional observations on. . . .

All authors should be named in references, even if there is a large number of them.

Journals

8.19     The general formats for journals and other professional periodicals are as follows:

Hochachka, P. W. 1990. Scope for survival: a conceptual “mirror” to Fry’s scope for activity.

Transactions of the American Fisheries Society 119:622–628.

Kennedy, V. S. 1990. Anticipated effects of climate change on estuarine and coastal fisheries.

Fisheries 15(6):16–24.

Whenever possible, AFS publications use the journal names given in the latest
edition of BIOSIS Serial Sources (BIOSIS, Philadelphia).

Note that the issue number (i.e., “6” in the second example) must be included
when each issue of the publication is paginated separately, as Fisheries was prior
to 2006.

CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS

8.20  Conference proceedings that appear in BIOSIS Serial Sources are treated like

journals; other conference proceedings are treated like books (see section 8.22).

Ansell, A. D. 1961. Egg capsules of the dogfish (Scylliorhinus canicula Linn.) bored by
Natica (Gastropoda: Prosobranchia). Proceedings of the Malacological Society of London
34:248–249.   [journal format]

Hashegan, K., editor. 1978. Proceedings of a national symposium on wild trout management.

California Trout, San Francisco.   [book format]

Note that in the case of proceedings treated as books the place of publication is the
location of the organization sponsoring the conference, not that of the conference
itself.

8.21  One frequently cited proceedings, that of the annual meeting of the Southeastern

Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, generally appears a year or two after the
meeting. To avoid confusion, references to this periodical should include the  year
of the meeting after the volume number:

Ott, R. A. 1987. Cost . . . impoundment. Proceedings of the Annual Conference Southeastern

Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies 39(1985):80–85.

If only the year of the meeting is known, use that as the year of publication and do
not give a year after the volume number.

Note that from 1947 to 1975 this organization was known as the Southeastern
Association of Game and Fish Commissioners and should be named as such in
references (proceedings before 1954 should be treated as unpublished).

 Books

8.22     The general formats for books are as follows:

Brönmark, C., and L.-A. Hansson. 1998. The biology of lakes and ponds. Oxford University

Press, New York.

lakes. Wiley, New York.

Note that in titles the only words that should be capitalized are the first word and
other words that would be capitalized in ordinary text. The number of pages should
not be given.

In publishers’ names, nonessential terms such as “Company,” “Inc.,” and “Ltd”
should be omitted.

When the city of publication is well known, the name of the state or country in
which it is located should be omitted; see section 8.47 for details.

8.23     When a book has been reprinted without revision, this must be indicated:

Piper, R. G., I. B. McElwain, L. E. Orme, J. P. McCraren, L. G. Fowler, and J. R. Leonard.
1982. Fish hatchery management. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Washington, D.C. (4th

London.

SPECIAL AFS PUBLICATIONS

8.24

In addition to books, AFS publishes lengthy monographs, symposia proceedings,
and other, special publications, references to which are formatted as follows:

Waters, T. F. 1995. Sediment in streams: sources, biological effects, and control. American

Fisheries Society, Monograph 7, Bethesda, Maryland.

Coutant, C. C., editor. 2001. Behavioral technologies for fish guidance. American Fisheries

P. L. Fuller, L. G. Nico, and J. D. William. 1999. Nonindigenous fishes introduced into

inland waters of the United States. American Fisheries Society, Special Publication 27,
Bethesda, Maryland.

Note that the number of the monograph, symposium volume, and so forth is
sufficient; designations such as “number” and “no.” should be omitted.

8.25  The various chapters, divisions, and sections of AFS also publish proceedings and
other book-length documents, some of which are part of the Special Publications
series and others of which are stand-alone. References to the former are formatted as
indicated in section 8.24; references to the latter are formatted as follows:

Howell, P. J., and D. V. Buchanan, editors. 1992. Proceedings of the Gearhart Mountain Bull

Trout workshop. American Fisheries Society, Oregon Chapter, Corvallis.

Esocid Technical Committee. 1992. Synopsis of research and management. American Fisheries

Society, North Central Division, Bethesda, Maryland.

Starnes, L. B., editor. 1985. Fish and wildlife relationships to mining: symposium proceedings.

American Fisheries Society, Water Quality Section, Bethesda, Maryland.

THE “BLUE BOOK”

8.26  References to the Fish Health Section’s “Blue Book” should be formatted as follows:

biological cycles in lakes: some examples. Pages 15–22 in N. A. McGinn, editor. Fisheries in
a changing climate. American Fisheries Society, Symposium 32, Bethesda, Maryland.

not

Lofgren, B. M. 2002. Global warming influences on water levels, ice, and chemical and

biological cycles in lakes: some examples. American Fisheries Society Symposium 32:15–22.

Reports

8.28  Reports that are included in BIOSIS Serial Sources (because they are issued as

part of a regular series) are treated much as other periodicals:

Everest, F. H., C. E. McLemore, and J. F. Ward. 1980. An improved tri-tube cryogenic gravel

sampler. U.S. Forest Service Research Note PNW-350.

8.29     The general format for other reports is as follows:

USEPA (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency). 1986. Quality criteria for water. USEPA,

Report 440/5-86-001, Washington, D.C.

May, B., and R. Zubik. 1985. Quantitative. . . . Annual Report to the Bonneville Power

Administration, Project 83-465, Portland, Oregon.

For reports by government agencies, use the name of the agency that appears on the
title page of the report. As a rule, it is not necessary to give all of the organizational
levels:

National Park Service

not   U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service.

When it is desirable to give more than one level, however, they should be listed
from largest to smallest:

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Ocean Service

Capitalize terms such as “Final Report” and “Completion Report” that pertain to
final, published documents; do not capitalize terms such as “preliminary report”
and “draft report,” which pertain to what is essentially gray literature. Where
relevant, provide project numbers.

FEDERAL AID IN (SPORT) FISH RESTORATION ACT REPORTS

8.30  Reports stemming from projects funded by the Federal Aid in Fish Restoration Act
(popularly known as the Dingell–Johnson Act) and its successor, the Federal
Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act (the Wallop–Breaux Act), should be listed as
follows:

Anderson, R. 1978. Age . . . Kamloops. Idaho Department of Fish and Game, Federal Aid in

Fish Restoration, Projects F-53-R-12 and F-53-R-13, Final Report, Boise.

Zuerlein, G. 1984. Statewide fishing survey. Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, Federal Aid

in Sport Fish Restoration, Project F-73-R, Final Report, Lincoln.

Note that the publisher is always the state agency to which the grant was awarded.
Study and job numbers may be included after the project number but are not required.

SEA GRANT REPORTS

8.31  A few of the reports stemming from projects funded by the National Sea Grant

College Program are listed in BIOSIS Serial Sources and should be formatted
accordingly. The general format for other such reports is as follows:

Hewett, S. W., and B. L. Johnson. 1987. A generalized bioenergetics model of fish growth for

microcomputers. University of Wisconsin, Sea Grant Institute, Technical Report WIS-SG-87-
245, Madison.

Kapuscinski, A. R., and L. D. Jacobson. 1987. Genetic guidelines for fisheries management.

University of Minnesota, Minnesota Sea Grant College Program, Sea Grant Research Report 17,
Duluth.

Note that because the different institutions receiving Sea Grant funds name and
number their reports in different ways, there is no standardized nomenclature for
these reports.

Legal Documents

FEDERAL LAWS

8.32  There are three stages to the publication of a federal law: (1) upon enactment, it is

published as a “slip” law; thereafter, it is incorporated into (2) United States Statutes
at Large, which is updated annually, and (3) the United States Code, which is
updated every 6 years. The appropriate reference thus depends on the particular stage
of publication:

Fisheries Preservation Act of 1998. Public Law 723, 105th Congress, 2nd session

(22 April 1998).   [slip law]

Fisheries Preservation Act of 1998. U.S. Statutes at Large 111:1012–1025.

Fisheries Preservation Act of 1998. U.S. Code, volume 36, sections 1876–1884.

In each case the text citation would be as follows:

(Fisheries Preservation Act of 1998)

If the title of the act does not include the year of passage, provide that in the citation
and reference:

(National Environmental Policy Act 1970)

National Environmental Policy Act. 1970. U.S. Code, volume 42, sections 4321–4347.

FEDERAL REGULATIONS AND OTHER U.S. OFFICE OF THE FEDERAL REGISTER PUBLICATIONS

STATE LAWS

8.35  References to codified state laws should be formatted as follows:

Fish Habitat Expansion Act. 2004. Code of Maryland, section 1234.5678.

References to uncodified laws should generally follow the format for federal slip laws
(section 8.32), providing enough information to enable the reader to locate the source.

COURT DECISIONS

8.36  References to court decisions should follow standard legal format except that the date

should appear right after the name of the case:

Hill v. TVA. 1977. 549 F.2d 1074 (6th Cir.)

The corresponding text citation would be

(Hill v. TVA 1977)

OTHER LEGAL DOCUMENTS

8.37  References to congressional hearings should be formatted as follows:

session).

The text citation would be

(U.S. House of Representatives 1969)

References to executive orders should follow the formats for the Federal Register
(section 8.34) or the United States Code (section 8.32), depending on their stage of
publication.

Comments

8.38  The formats for comments vary somewhat, depending on the treatment in the

source journal:

If a journal is available in print form, use the standard reference format even if you
accessed the article online:

Vinson, M. R., E. C. Dinger, and D. K. Vinson. 2010. Piscicides and invertebrates: after 70 years,

does anyone really know? Fisheries 35:61–71.

If a journal is only available in electronic form, the format depends on the
information given for the individual articles:

Gallagher, M. B., and S. S. Heppell. 2010. Essential habitat identification for age-0 rockfish along
the central Oregon coast. Marine and Coastal Fisheries: Dynamics, Management, and Ecosystem
Science [online serial] 2:60–72.

Kimmerer, W. J. 2004. Open-water processes of the San Francisco Estuary: from physical forcing to
biological responses. San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science [online serial] 2(1):article 1.

As suggested by the examples above, references should include as much of the
standard information as possible (such as volume, issue, and page numbers) as well as
the designation “[online serial].” Digital object identifiers (DOIs) should only be
included for articles still in press.

Databases should be cited as follows:

Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission. 2015. PTAGIS (Columbia Basin PIT Tag Information
System) [online database]. Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, Portland, Oregon.
Available: www.ptagis.org.

The “author” should be the organization(s) that maintain(s) the database; if there are
more than five such organizations, use the name of the database as the author. The
year should be the year in which the database was accessed. If additional information
is necessary to enable readers to locate the exact source, it may be given in the text
citation.

Software packages should be noted only in the text; see section 13.3.

Patents

8.45     References to patents should be formatted as follows:

When there is an assignee, the name of the assignee should appear before the title of
the patent and be followed a comma and the word “assignee.”

MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS

Names of Places of Publication

8.46

If the name of the publisher includes a state, province, or country name, do not
repeat the name:

Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, Madison
Australian Museum, Sidney

If the name of the publisher includes a city name, however, that name should be
repeated:

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK
Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama

Note that cities in the United Kingdom are followed only by the country name,
abbreviated to “UK.”

8.47  The names of the following cities need not be followed by a state, province, or

Multiple Publications by an Author in a Given Year

8.48

It is not uncommon for there to be more than one reference to a particular author
(either individually, with the same coauthors, or with different coauthors) in a
particular year. In reference lists, publications by single authors should appear in the
order in which they are cited in the text with the lowercase letters “a,” “b,” and so
forth appended to the year of publication.

Publications with more than one author are treated similarly, except that they
should appear in alphabetical order by the authors’ last names:

Benfey, T., R. S. Thomas, and R. T. Thompson. 1985a.
Benfey, T., G. Williams, and R. T. Thompson. 1985b.

Note that references with more than one author won’t necessarily appear right
together (e.g., a publication by Benfey and Underwood would come between the
two Benfey et al. references in the above example).

See section 8.3 for the citation of such publications in the text.

Non-English Publications

8.49  The formats for publications not (or not originally) in English vary depending on

whether the original language uses the Latin alphabet and whether a partial or
complete translation is available.

9.  Species Names

GENERAL

9.1

In AFS publications, the standard practice is to give the accepted common and
scientific names the first time that a species is mentioned in the abstract and text
and to use only the common name thereafter. The format for the first mention is as
follows:

Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum

(note the absence of parentheses around the scientific name). As indicated in
subsequent sections, however, there are numerous exceptions to this practice,
depending on the particular species in question, the authority for the names, and the
frequency with which the names are used.

Most common names of fishes are now capitalized (see section 9.7 for further
information).

9.2

References to a genus that has already been mentioned may be abbreviated unless
they occur at the beginning of a sentence or there is a possibility of confusion (e.g.,
two or more genera beginning with the same letter):

Threadfin Shad D. petenense

9.3  Where appropriate, genus and family names may be used in lieu of species names:

Lepomis spp.   in the genus Micropterus   ictalurids   pikes (family Esocidae)

Note that the abbreviation “sp.” refers to a single (unidentified) species within a
genus, the abbreviation “spp.” to two or more species within a genus.

More general references to living organisms do not require scientific names:

coldwater fishes   benthic invertebrates

9.4

As a rule, the full common name should be given at each use:

Coho Salmon   not   Coho

However, if the name is long or used frequently and there is no possibility of
confusion, it may be shortened after the first use in each paragraph:

trout [for Westslope Cutthroat Trout]

Alternatively, the general term “fish” may be used in such cases.

9.5

If the first mention of a species (apart from any in the abstract) occurs in a table or
figure, the scientific name should be given there and not repeated in the body of the
text, and vice versa. However, for the sake of completeness, a scientific name that has
previously been given in the text may be repeated in a table when the scientific names
of other species are first given in that table.

9.6

Scientific names should not be used adjectively unless the alternative is cumbersome:

populations of Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha

not   Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha populations

 but   Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha fry

9.7

Following the usage in the 7th edition of Common and Scientific Names of Fishes

from the United States, Canada, and Mexico (AFS Special Publication 34; 2013),

new rules apply to the capitalization of species names.

Capitalize

•

•

•

•

the common names of all fish species, including those not in Common and Scientific

Names and other AFS taxonomic publications

the common names of subspecies (e.g., Lahontan Cutthroat Trout)

Do not capitalize

the names of life history variants (e.g., steelhead) and hybrids (e.g., saugeye)

the common names of nonfish species, even if they appear in an AFS taxonomic

publication

•  common names that refer to groups of related species (e.g., Pacific salmons, darters)

•

the common portions of names shared by two or more species when they are

mentioned as a group (e.g., Gizzard and Threadfin shads [see section 2.12])

Common names that appear in references should be capitalized if they meet the

current criteria for capitalization—even if they were not capitalized in the original

publication.

NAMES OF FISH AND OTHER AQUATIC ANIMALS

Species in AFS’s Names of Fishes

9.8

AFS is the recognized authority on the names of fishes and a few other aquatic
species that are indigenous to North America. The currently accepted names of these
species are given in the 7th edition of Common and Scientific Names of Fishes from
the United States, Canada, and Mexico. For species covered by that publication
(including exotic species),

•  Use the accepted common and scientific names in the abstract and text as indicated

in section 9.1; use only the common name in the title

•  Use alternative names only if the names committee has endorsed them in the main

listings or the notes

Species in Other AFS Taxonomic Publications

9.9

AFS also publishes lists of the names of species for which it is not the primary
authority, the most important of which is World Fishes Important to North
Americans (Special Publication 21). For species covered by those publications,

•  Scientific names should be given in the title as well as in the abstract and text

•  Common names may be included in the title but are not required

•  Alternative common and scientific names are permitted

There are two qualifications with respect to the use of alternative names. First, there
should be a bridge to the preferred name in World Fishes:

Gilthead Seabream (also known as Gilthead Bream) Sparus auratus

Second, if an alternative common name is the same as that of another species
covered by an AFS publication, the common name should be omitted from the title
and abstract and an explanation given in the text:

Whitefish Coregonus lavaretus (known as Powan in North America)

Species Covered by Other Sources

9.10

In the case of names of species not covered by AFS publications,

•  Scientific names should be included in the title as well as in the abstract and text

•  Common names may be used but are not required

Copy editors should use whatever resources are available (e.g., Marine Mammals of
the World and Internet searches) to verify the name(s) that the author uses and query
the author about any discrepancies.

9.11     At first mention, the names of subspecies are presented as follows:

Coastal Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii

(see the AFS publication Native Trout of Western North America [Monograph 6;
1992] for guidance on the names of subspecies of trout). As Names of Fishes and
World Fishes do not give common or scientific names for subspecies, authors will be
given a fair amount of latitude in this regard.

DIFFERENT LIFE HISTORIES

9.12

Some fish species have more than one common name because of differences in
life history. The most familiar variants are steelhead (the anadromous form of
Rainbow Trout) and kokanee (the lacustrine form of Sockeye Salmon).

When only one form is mentioned in the paper, it should be presented in the usual
way:

steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss    kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka

When both forms are mentioned, how they are presented depends on which is
mentioned first:

Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss

then

steelhead (anadromous Rainbow Trout)

steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss (anadromous Rainbow Trout)

then  Rainbow Trout

Sockeye Salmon Oncorhynchus nerka

then  kokanee (lacustrine Sockeye Salmon)

kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka (lacustrine Sockeye Salmon)

then  Sockeye Salmon

STRAINS, STOCKS, AND RUNS

9.13     Strains are variants that are maintained by culture:

Seneca Lake Trout

As a rule, copy editors should follow the author with respect to such names. When
the strain name does not indicate the species in question, however, clarifying
information should be given in the title, abstract, and text. For instance, the title of an
article about koi (a variant of Common Carp) should refer to “koi carp,” and the

abstract and text should introduce the species by means of a phrase such as “koi, a
variant of Common Carp Cyprinus carpio” (after which “koi” alone may be used).

Stocks are populations that are managed as a unit. They usually have geographic
names:

Chesapeake Bay Striped Bass

If there is any possibility that the stock portion of the name will be considered part of
the common name per se, the distinction should be made clear:

Gulf of Mexico population of Atlantic Sturgeon

Runs consist of members of a species that are migrating to spawn in a particular
season:

fall-run [or fall] Chum Salmon

Copy editors should follow the author with respect to stock and run names unless the
names used are unclear.

HYBRIDS

9.14     In the abstract and text, the names of hybrids are presented as follows:

tiger muskellunge (Northern Pike Esox lucius × Muskellunge E. masquinongy)

the names of the component species being given in alphabetical order by scientific
name. When the sex of the parents matters, that should be given as well:

sunshine bass (female White Bass Morone chrysops × male Striped Bass M. saxatilis)

In titles, the common names of hybrids that appear in Names of Fishes may be
given without indicating the parent species. In other cases involving species
named in Names of Fishes, the parent species should be given.

TAXONOMIC AND SYSTEMATICS PAPERS

9.15  Scientific names may be used throughout such papers, including in the title.

Common names should be given in parentheses at the first mention of the species or
genus. Scientific names may be used in some places and common names in others if
this makes sense in the context of the paper (for an example, see R. F. Stearley and
G. R. Smith. 1993. Phylogeny of the Pacific trouts and salmons [Oncorhynchus] and
genera of the family Salmonidae. Transactions of the American Fisheries Society
122:1–33).

NEW SPECIES

9.16

In the case of a newly described species, the scientific name must appear in the title
and may be used in lieu of the common name throughout. Authors will be requested
to provide documentation of the name, and the matter will be referred to the chair of
the Committee on Names of Fishes for confirmation.

NOTE ON TILAPIA SPECIES

9.17  Although many tilapia species formerly had two scientific names (e.g., Oreochromis
niloticus or Tilapia nilotica for Nile Tilapia, depending on whether the Trewavas or
Thys system was used), all tilapia species now have only one:

Nile Tilapia Oreochromis niloticus   Redbelly Tilapia Tilapia zillii

NAMES OF OTHER SPECIES

9.18  Whenever possible, provide the full common and scientific names of other species

mentioned in AFS publications:

Douglas-fir Pseudotsuga menziesii   double-crested cormorant Phalacrocorax auritus

9.19  When there is no common name (as is the case with bacteria and some insects),

use the scientific name throughout, abbreviating the genus name after the first use:

Myxobolus cerebralis

When there is no scientific name (as is the case with viruses and cell lines), use the
common name or its acronym throughout:

infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV)

Chinook Salmon embryo (CHSE-214) cells

Note that the scientific name for Chinook Salmon is not included in the name of the
cell line derived from that species.

Daphnia and Brine Shrimp

9.20  Two common food items of fish—daphnia and brine shrimp—are often not

identified beyond the genus level. At first mention, they should be indicated as
follows:

daphnia Daphnia spp.   brine shrimp Artemia spp.

Either the common or scientific name may be used in subsequent mentions as long
as the usage is consistent:

daphnia   or   Daphnia

brine shrimp   or   Artemia

If a particular species with no common name is referred to, its scientific name may
be used throughout:

A. salina

PLURALS

Fish

9.21  A comprehensive list of the plurals of fish names used in AFS publications is given in

Appendix C. The principles governing the formation of these plurals are as follows:

As in other matters pertaining to spelling, the general authority in this area is
Webster’s Third New International Dictionary (as updated by the current edition of
Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary).

The vast majority of fish names form their plurals by adding s or es, with stem
changes where required:

Bluegills (not Bluegill)   Guppies   Ciscoes

This is especially true for compound names:

Walleyes   Alewives   but   Yellowtail   steelhead

In a few cases, the plural is the same as the singular (note that this is not a
complete list):

trout   bass   salmon   grouper

In the following seven cases, more than one plural is acceptable:

Dolly Varden(s)   drum(s)   kokanee(s)   Ruffe(s)   sculpin(s)   sturgeon(s)   tilapia(s)

The usage should be consistent, however.

9.22  When a plural refers to more than one species (as distinct from more than one
individual of the same species), it should be formed by adding s or es:

Rainbow and Brook trouts

[i.e., Rainbow Trout and Brook Trout]

Other Taxa

9.23  By and large, the principles given above also pertain to the plurals of taxa other than
fish. Authors will be given a little more leeway, however, especially when more than
one form is commonly used.

10.  Spelling and Compound Words

SPELLING

10.1  The general authority on the spelling of words in AFS publications is Webster’s

Third New International Dictionary (as updated by the current edition of Merriam-
Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary). In some cases, however, sense or the customary
usage in the fisheries profession require deviations from the forms given in this
dictionary.

See Appendix A for a list of the accepted spellings of words and phrases
commonly found in fisheries writing.

Variants

10.2     Use U.S. rather than British spellings except in addresses, the names of organizations,

the titles of works, and similar items.

When the dictionary presents two or more variants and the variants have equal
weight (indicated by the conjunction “or” in the dictionary), use the shorter one:

totaled   not   totalled

If the variants are the same length, either may be used.

When the variants do not have equal weight (indicated by the conjunction “also”), use
the first one regardless of length:

cancellation   not   cancelation

Words with Prefixes

10.3

In general, prefixes should be closed up with the root words to which they are
attached:

nonintuitive   antioxidant   prechallenge

Extensive lists of words with common prefixes may be found in Merriam-
Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary.

EXCEPTIONS

10.4  Use a hyphen after the prefix if the root word is capitalized:

non-Canadian   neo-Darwinism

mid-April   but   from mid to late April

10.5  Use a hyphen after the prefix if the word would otherwise be ambiguous or hard to

read:

un-ionized   cross-sectional   multi-institutional

but   preexisting   microorganism

10.6  Use hyphens when more than one prefix is used with the same root word or the

root word is compound:

over- or underrepresented

          pre-yolk-sac

non-point-source pollution   but   point source pollution

COMPOUND WORDS

10.7  The spelling of compound words can be tricky; authors should consult the following
authorities (in this order) for any such words that they use: (1) Appendix A, (2)
Webster’s Third New International Dictionary (or the current edition of Merriam-
Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary), and (3) the principles given below.

Section 7.90 of the Chicago Manual of Style (15th edition) also contains useful
examples, though it occasionally deviates from AFS style.

Noun Forms

10.8

In general, compounds that serve as nouns are left “open” (i.e., with spaces between
the individual words) unless the constituent parts are closely linked or the
compounds are generally recognized:

main stem   open water   radio tag

   fishpond   riverbed   seawater

A few technical terms have hyphens, however:

age-class   eye-up   net-pen

(Note that this is not a complete list of such terms.)

Adjective Forms

10.9  Compounds that serve as adjectives are treated in various ways, depending on the

particular form and its position in the sentence.

NOUN–NOUN COMBINATIONS

10.10   Compounds consisting of two or more nouns are usually left open:

age structure differentials   sea surface temperatures

However, they may be hyphenated to avoid awkwardness or ambiguity:

NOUN–VERB PARTICIPLE COMBINATIONS

population-level analyses

10.11   Compounds consisting of a noun and a present or past participle are hyphenated:

decision-making authority   oxygen-depleted waters

ADJECTIVE–NOUN COMBINATIONS

10.12  Compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun are hyphenated unless the open

form is very familiar:

main-stem reaches   second-order stream   cost-effective measures

but   high school participants

COMBINATIONS INVOLVING ADVERBS

10.13   Compounds containing an adverb that ends in “-ly” are never hyphenated:

rapidly changing situation

10.14  With the exceptions noted in section 10.15, compounds containing other adverbs are

hyphenated:

well-written article   much-replicated research

10.15   Compounds containing “very,” “most,” and “least” are left open:

COMBINATIONS INVOLVING UNITS OF MEASURE

very respected scientist   least intensive effort

10.16   Compounds containing units of measure are hyphenated:

1.5-mg/L treatment

PREDICATE POSITION

10.17   Compounds that appear after the nouns they modify are left open:

These measures were cost effective.   The article was well written.

Verb Forms

10.18  The treatment of compounds that serve as verbs is so irregular that no general rules

can be given:

run off   break up   grow out

dipnet   download   livetrap

mass-mark   PIT-tag   air-dry

To determine which form to use, consult the references given in section 10.7.

Use of En Dashes

10.19  In AFS publications, en dashes are generally used instead of hyphens in compounds

in which the en dash stands for “and,” “to,” or “at”:

Beverton–Holt analysis   length–weight ratio   University of California–Davis

but   Smith-Root [legal name]

11.  Symbols

This chapter explains the treatment of certain symbols and other technical
designations that are commonly used in fisheries science. Symbols pertaining to
mathematics and statistics are covered in Chapter 4; see also the list of
abbreviations and acronyms in Appendix B.

Cell Cycle Phase

11.1  Cell cycle phases are indicated by capital letters in nonitalic type, i.e., G0 (the

quiescent phase after cell division), G1 (the primary growth phase), S (the phase in
which the genome is replicated), G2 (the growth phase in which the cell prepares for
genomic separation), M (mitosis [genomic separation]), and C (cytokinesis [cell
division]).

Cell Lines and Bacterial Strains

11.2  Cell lines are usually indicated by their acronyms, but the type must be spelled out

at first mention:

Chinook Salmon embryo (CHSE-214) cells

11.3  For bacterial strains that are maintained by standard type culture collections, the

collection should be noted at first mention:

Flavobacterium psychrophilum (ATCC 49418)

The acronym ATCC may be used in lieu of the full name (American Type
Culture Collection) because it is a standard acronym listed in Appendix B.

For strains that are maintained by individual laboratories, the laboratories’
identifying codes should be given:

Aeromonas 1-75

Chemical Terms

11.4  Standard chemical symbols may be used for elements, compounds, and equations

without further explanation:

P   H

+
   NH3   C6H12O6 + 6 O2 → 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + energy

If a sentence begins with the name of an element or compound, however, that name
must be spelled out along with any others that occur in the sentence:

Phosphorus and nitrogen. . . .   not  P and N. . . .   or   Phosphorus and N. . . .

11.5     Compounds may also be indicated by their generic and “chemical” names:

formalin   rotenone   [generic]

17β-hydroxyandrost-4-en-3-one   [chemical]

Letters indicating the dextro and levo configurations (D- and L-, respectively, should
be small capitals.

The following prefixes should be italicized:

   priority groups are on the same side of the reference plane
   meta
   attached to a nitrogen atom (e.g., N-methylpyridine)
   ortho
   attached to an oxygen atom (e.g., O-acetylhydroxylamine)
   para
   attached to a sulfur atom (e.g., S-methylcysteine)
   tertiary

cis-
m-
N-
o-
O-
p-
S-
tert-
trans-     priority groups are on opposite sides of the reference plane

Generic names that appear in Webster’s Third New International Dictionary (or the
current edition of Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary) or as main entries in the
Merck Index (Merck & Co., Rahway, New Jersey) or Dorland’s Illustrated Medical
Dictionary (W. B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia) may be used without a chemical
name. Other generic names must be accompanied by a chemical name at first
mention.

11.6  Acronyms that appear in Webster’s Third New International Dictionary or the
current edition of Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary do not need to be
spelled out:

TRADE NAMES

DDT   EDTA

11.7  Compounds may be referred to by trade name, but the generic name or a general

description must be given at first mention:

MS-222 (tricaine methanesulfonate)

the vaccine Furogen 2

Trade names are often capitalized (see section 2.5).

FATTY ACIDS

11.8  Fatty acids may be indicated by name (e.g., linolenic acid) or by notation of the

sort

18:2(n-6)   or   18:2(ω-6),

where the number to the left of the colon is the number of carbon atoms in the
compound, the number immediately to the right of the colon is the number of
double bonds, and the number after the hyphen indicates the position of the first
double bond from the methyl end.

The numerical notation must be accompanied by an explanation like that above.

When used to indicate a class, terms such as “n-6” should not be in parentheses.

RADIOACTIVE ELEMENTS

11.9     Radioactive elements may be indicated in either of the following two ways:

14

C  or  carbon-14

The usage must be consistent within the paper, however.

Enzymes

11.10  At first mention, standard enzymes (those with names ending in “-ase”) are
referred to both by name and by the numbers assigned to them by the
Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and
Molecular Biology:

creatine kinase (enzyme number 2.7.3.2; IUBMB 1992)

+

+

,K

Na

-ATPase (3.6.1.36)

The following citation should appear in the list of references:1

IUBMB (International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology). 1992. Enzyme
nomenclature 1992. Academic Press, San Diego, California.

As the above examples suggest, the IUBMB citation and the words “enzyme
number” need only appear in the text the first time an enzyme number is given.

1 This volume has been updated by various supplements that appeared in the European Journal of Biochemistry
from 1993 to 1999. Subsequent supplements have been posted on the IUBMB’s Web site,
www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme. Authors should cite whatever source is most appropriate.

11.11  After full identification, enzymes may be abbreviated according to the

conventions adopted by the Fish Genetics Nomenclature Committee of AFS’s
Fish Genetics Section (see J. B. Shaklee et al. 1990. Gene nomenclature for
protein-coding loci in fish. Transactions of the American Fisheries Society
119:2−15, especially Tables 1 and 2):

CK   [creatine kinase]

bGAL   or   βGAL   [beta-galactosidase]

sAAT, mAAT   [cytosolic and mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase]

IDHP-1, IDHP-2   [isozymes of isocitrate dehydrogenase]

RESTRICTION ENZYMES

11.12  Restriction enzymes (also known as endonucleases) are derived from bacteria and

have a different nomenclature that reflects their origin:

Taq   Acc I   Hinc II

Thus, Taq is derived from the bacterium Thermus aquaticus, Acc I is the first
enzyme derived from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Hinc II is the second
enzyme derived from the Rc strain of Haemophilus influenzae.

Note that when the name has more than three letters only the first three are
italicized.

Gas Pressure

11.13   The partial pressure of a gas is indicated as follows:

PO2   or   pO2

Note that letters such as O (for oxygen) are in small capitals.

Genetics

11.14  Genes (also known as loci) are designated by the abbreviations of the enzymes they
encode, with two typographic differences: (1) an asterisk follows the enzyme
abbreviation and (2) the entire expression (including the asterisk) is italicized:

CK*   bGAL*   (but βGAL*)   sAAT*   IDHP-1*

The enzymes themselves should be named in full (see section 11.10) when such
abbreviations are used.

Designations for genes that encode subunits of enzymes are italicized but not
followed by an asterisk:

ND-4   ND-6   [subunits of NADH (the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)
dehydrogenase]

ALLELES

11.15  Alleles may be indicated by appending Arabic numbers, lowercase letters, or

relative electrophoretic mobilities to the gene abbreviations:

EST-2*1, EST-2*2 . . .   or   EST-2*a, EST-2*b . . .   or   EST-2*100, EST-2*75 . . .

The Fish Genetics Nomenclature Committee recommends using Arabic numbers but
providing the corresponding electrophoretic mobilities. However alleles are
designated, a full description of the conditions under which the electrophoretic
differences were determined should be given.

Alleles may be indicated without the gene abbreviations as long as it is clear to
which genes they belong:

Four alleles of EST-2* were observed: *1, *2, *3, and * 4 [or *100, *43, *75, and *150].

Multiple alleles in a genotype should be separated by forward slashes:

EST-1*100/55   sAAT-1,2*130/100/100/80

Haplotypes, which are groups of alleles that are inherited together, are printed in
nonitalic type:

MICROSATELLITES

MYS21

11.16  Microsatellites are a class of nuclear DNA markers consisting of small (1−5-base-

pair) repeating sequences that are often studied in lieu of genes per se. They are
designated solely by their abbreviations, which are italicized except for any Greek
letters they contain:

PLOIDY

Ots1   Ssa85   Oneµ3

11.17  Ploidy, the degree of repetition in the basic number of chromosomes that an

organism possesses, is indicated by a number and a lowercase “n” in nonitalic type:

2n [diploidy]   4n [tetraploidy]

FILIAL GENERATION

11.18  Filial generation is indicated by a capital “F” in nonitalic type and a numerical

subscript:

FIXATION INDEXES

F1

11.19   Fixation indexes are statistics of the form

F = (He – Ho)/He

that measure the degree of difference between expected heterozygosity (He) and
observed heterozygosity (Ho). The most commonly used index, which compares the
genetic composition of discrete populations within a larger metapopulation, is
denoted FST. It is not necessary to provide a detailed explanation of such an index,
but a general explanation should be given at first mention:

the genetic differentiation index FST

Note that the subscript is in capital letters.

DNA BASE CUTTING

11.20  The sites at which restriction enzymes cleave DNA may be indicated in a number of

ways, including the following:

C^(T/C)CG(A/G)G

C^T/CCGA/GG

C^PyCGPuG

5′. . .C/(T or C)CG(A or G)G. . .3′

5′-C/(T or C)CG(A or G)G-3′

5′ C/(T or C)CG(A or G)G 3′

In these expressions, the letters C, T, G, and A represent the four bases found in
DNA, namely, cytosine, thymine, guanine, and adenine (uracil [U] replaces
thymine in RNA). The numbers 5′ and 3′ refer to the carbon atoms at the two ends
of the nucleotide chain.

The fact that one of two alternative bases may be present at a particular site can be
indicated in four ways: (1) (T/C), (A/G); (2) T/C, A/G; (3) Py, Pu, which stand for
the pyrimidine (T, C) and purine (A, G) bases, respectively; and (4) (T or C), (A or
G).

In the first three examples, a caret (^) denotes the cutting site; in the last three
examples, a forward slash does.

Hormones and Antibodies

11.21  Hormones and antibodies may be denoted by their standard abbreviations or

acronyms but must be spelled out at first mention:

luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH)

  immunoglobulin A (IgA)

Lethal Concentrations and Doses

11.22  Terms indicating lethal concentrations and doses may be abbreviated but must be

explained in full at first use:

the concentration [dose] that was lethal to 50% of the test organisms over the first 96 h (LC50
[LD50])

the dose that produced a cytopathic effect in 50% of the inoculated cultures (TCID50)

Note that the percentage of organisms affected and the time of exposure may vary and
that numbers such as 50 are not treated as subscripts in AFS publications.

Fish Mortality

11.23   Symbols denoting fish mortality rates should be defined at first use:

instantaneous fishing mortality (F)

instantaneous natural mortality (M)

Subscripts are sometimes used to denote more specific mortality rates:

the fishing mortality at which yield per recruit is at a maximum (Fmax)

Fish Ages

11.24   References to fish by age-class may be made as follows:

age-0 Bluegills   age-2 fish

The term “young-of-the-year” may be used in lieu of  “age-0,” but it may not be
abbreviated to “YOY”:

young-of-the-year Bluegills   not   YOY Bluegills

A term such as “age-1+” may be used to refer to fish of age 1 and older as long as an
explanation is given. However, such a term may not be used just to indicate growth
beyond the first annulus.

ANADROMOUS SALMONIDS

11.25   The preferred way to refer to the age of an anadromous salmonid is as follows:

age 2.2   age 0.3

In this system, the first digit is the number of winters spent in freshwater and the
second digit is the number of winters spent in the ocean.

References to the freshwater or ocean portions of a fish’s life alone may be made as
follows:

age 2.   age .2

12.   Tables and Figures

12.1  Because the information that is given in tables and figures usually constitutes
the heart of a scientific paper, it needs to be presented in as precise and
accessible a way as possible.

TABLES

A sample table illustrating many of the points discussed below appears in
Example A at the end of this chapter.

Caption

12.2  The first sentence should state the contents of the table in a general way;

although many authors simply repeat the column headings in the first
sentence, this is not very informative and should be avoided whenever
possible. The first sentence does not have to be a complete sentence.

Subsequent sentences, which do have to be complete, should present other
information that is pertinent to the table as a whole. Although AFS style no
longer requires that tables be essentially self-standing (i.e., intelligible apart
from the text), captions should provide enough information that readers can
easily perceive the purpose and structure of each table. Where relevant, this
will include

•

•

•

•

the particular species involved and their gender(s) and age(s)

the body of water or laboratory at which the data were obtained (but not
the state, province, or country)

the method by which the specimens were collected (e.g., electroshocking)

the year and month or season in which the specimens were collected or the
experiments carried out

•

the statistical tests and significance levels used

•  definitions and explanations that apply to the entire table

The following caption, which shows the general format for captions, is a good
model:

TABLE 1.   Seasonal growth and survival (90-d means ± SDs) of age-1 Sockeye
Salmon that were tagged with one of three devices and released into floating net-pens in
Lake Genoa, 1987−1988. Asterisks denote significant differences from unmarked controls
(t-test; P ≤  0.05).

EXCEPTION

 A complete description of the study need not be repeated in the captions to
subsequent tables, provided that the context is clear. For instance, the caption
to the table following the one in the example above could be simply

TABLE 2.   Relative weights (90-d means ± SDs) of age-1 Sockeye Salmon in

tagging experiments.

12.3      To prevent a caption from becoming unwieldy,

•  Move units of measure to the straddle, column, or row headings whenever

possible (see sections 12.5−12.7)

•  Put narrowly focused definitions and explanations in footnotes

•  Do not define terms and abbreviations that are well known and defined in

the text (e.g., LWD [large woody debris])

•  When definitions and explanations are lengthy and have been given in a

previously mentioned table or figure, refer the reader to that table or figure
rather than repeating the information

•  When symbol definitions or detailed explanations are readily located in the

text, refer the reader to the text

SIGNIFICANCE LEVELS AND STANDARD DEVIATIONS

12.4

If there is one level of significance in a table, it may be noted as in the sample
caption above. Different levels of significance are usually indicated by
different numbers of asterisks, with an explanation such as the following at the
end of the caption:

. . .; P  ≤ 0.05*, P ≤  0.01**.    or    . . . (P  ≤ 0.05*, P  ≤ 0.01**).

Note that a symbol such as P may not begin a sentence.

The way in which standard deviations, standard errors, and confidence
intervals are presented may be explained in the caption or the row and column
headings, whichever is appropriate. The form of the explanation

should follow that of the presentation. For example, when the data are
presented in the form “9.5 ± 0.7,” the explanation should be of the form

mean ± SD

When the data are presented in the form “9.5 (0.7),” the explanation should be
of the form

mean (SD)    or    mean (SDs in parentheses)

Headings

12.5  Column headings may be individual (such as “Age-class” in Example A) or

grouped under a straddle heading (such as “Total weight [g]”), as appropriate.
Note that a straddle heading describes the items immediately below it, not the
data in the columns.

Column headings must indicate all of the information that appears beneath
them. When more than one type of information is given, this must be reflected
in the heading. For example, if the first column contains the names of various
locations and species of fish for which data are presented, the column heading
should read “Location and species.”

There should be only one set of column headings per table. To avoid having
more than one set, rearrange the table (such as by switching the rows and
columns) or split it into two or more tables.

12.6  Row headings need not be repeated when they apply to more than one row.

Subheadings should be indented the length of one em dash from the main
headings.

Bold centered headings (e.g., “Females” and “Males” in Example A) may be
used to distinguish different types of data. These headings must be distinct
from the row headings (i.e., they must not represent larger aggregations of the
items in the row headings), and they must not conflict with the column
headings.

12.7

If all of the data in the table have the same unit of measure, indicate it in the
caption. If different units of measure are involved, indicate them in the
appropriate column, straddle, or row headings.

12.8  When the names of months are used in headings, they should be abbreviated to

their first three letters; years should be given in their entirety. Date
designations such as “6/21/06” are not permitted; use “Jun 21, 2006” instead.

12.9  Special rules apply to the capitalization of terms beginning with a number or

symbol when they are used in headings.

Capitalize the first word of a hyphenated term unless it involves a unit of
measure:

α-Testosterone   L-Thyroxine   but   3-year-old fish   6-week analysis

Do not capitalize the first word of an unhyphenated term or one in which
capitalization would be apt to cause confusion:

1998 year-class    % of mean    t-test

Body

The entries in the body of a table should be arranged so that they are as easy to
read as possible. To this end, the press automatically formats these entries
according to certain rules. However, there are a few formatting matters for
which authors are responsible.

12.10  The press aligns numerical entries on a decimal point (which may not be

shown explicitly), an en dash, or a plus/minus symbol (±), depending on the
particular form of the data.

12.11  Authors should insert blank lines to divide rows of data into logical groups.

Blank lines may also be used to break up long columns of data.

12.12  Authors are also responsible for the correct placement of the lowercase letters

that indicate the statistical equivalence or nonequivalence of values within a
row or column (z, y, x, . . .); such letters should be put on the same lines as the
values to which they refer and be separated from them by single spaces.

Note that the letter z may indicate either the largest or the smallest value(s) but
that the other letters must then follow suit (e.g., if z indicates the largest
value(s), y must indicate the next largest, and so forth). Do not use the
sequence a, b, c, . . . in statistical comparisons because these letters are
reserved for footnotes.

If all of the values in a table are statistically equivalent, note that in the caption
rather than by letters. Otherwise, each value in a comparison must be
accompanied by a letter; do not use the absence of letters to indicate
equivalence.

Footnotes

12.13  Footnotes should be indicated by superscripts starting with the lowercase letter

“a.” They do not need to be complete sentences but must end with periods.
Avoid using footnotes in captions.

Extensions and Continuations

12.14  If a table is too wide to fit on one page, the press will “extend” it onto a facing
page, so that column m on the left-hand page is followed by column m + 1 on
the right-hand page. For clarity, the row headings are repeated on the right-
hand page. Alternatively, the author may be asked to condense the table.

12.15  If a table is too long to fit on one page, the press will “continue” it onto a

facing page, so that row n on the left-hand page is followed by row n + 1 on
the right-hand page. The column headings are repeated on the right-hand page;
the row headings may also be repeated if necessary for clarity.

Appendix and Supplementary Tables

In addition to the standard elements of a paper, authors may submit certain
supplementary material, such as additional data or results, the derivations of
equations, computer code, and so forth. For publication purposes, such
material will be treated either as an appendix (which will appear with the
article in both the print and online versions) or as a supplement (which will
appear only in the online version). In terms of format, appendices should be
regarded as extensions of articles and thus follow AFS style strictly.
Supplements, by contrast, may be in any format that is suitable for their
contents; however, (1) there should be consistency between the symbols,
abbreviations, and so forth used in the supplement and those used in the article
and (2) either the title of the supplement or the first paragraph should make
clear how it relates to the article.

12.16  There is only one difference between the treatment of tables that appear in

appendices and that of those that appear in the text, namely, that the number is
preceded by the letter A and a period:

TABLE A.1.   . . .

If there is more than one appendix, they should be numbered A.1, A.2, and so
forth and the tables within them A.1.1, A.1.2, . . ., A.2.1, and so forth. All
appendices should begin with centered headings in bold, even those that only
contain tables.

The treatment of supplementary tables is the same as that of appendix tables
except that the letter S replaces the letter A in the table designations (e.g.,
Table S.1).

FIGURES

Figures include visual materials such as graphs, maps, diagrams, and
photographs. Like tables, they may appear in the text, one or more appendices,
or one or more supplements. This section outlines the stylistic requirements
for figures; authors should also consult the guidelines for the individual AFS
publications for specific technical requirements (e.g., electronic format).

The primary responsibility for correct figure design and formatting rests with
authors. Although the press has the ability to make minor changes, figures will
be returned to authors for major changes, possibly delaying publication.

At the most fundamental level, figure design should follow certain
commonsense principles: figures should be as simple and straightforward as
possible, have a high enough resolution to be easily readable, and be
consistent in the use of lettering, line widths, and other graphic elements. They
also need to conform to AFS style.

It is particularly important to remember that many figures will be reduced by
35−50% when printed and thus need to be designed with this in mind. Some of
the guidelines that follow address this issue, but as a safeguard we urge
authors to use a copier to reduce each figure to the width of one or two printed
columns and the appropriate height (for the four print journals, the single- and
double-column widths are approximately 2.75 and 5.62 in, respectively, and
the height is 7.25 in; for other AFS publications (e.g., books and Fisheries),
consult the specific guidelines for those publications). Every element should
still be legible and all symbols, shadings, and so forth distinct after reduction.

12.17  Captions

Place each figure caption immediately below the figure to which it pertains.
Figures that appear in appendices and supplements should be numbered like
appendix and supplementary tables.

Like the captions for tables (sections 12.2–12.4), those for figures should
generally be comprehensive enough to enable the reader to understand the
figures without reference to the text. However, to the extent possible, include
full variable names, units of measure, panel descriptions, legends, and so forth
in the figure itself rather than in the caption. Identify abbreviations and
nonstandard symbols in the caption.

If symbols such as “A” and “B” are used to designate different panels within a
figure, in the caption (1) the letters should be in parentheses, (2) both the letter
and the parentheses should be in bold the first time they occur, and (3) the
letter should come before the description of the item to which it refers. Capital
letters are strongly preferred, but in any case the letters should be exactly the
same in the figure and caption (e.g., if the figure uses “a” and “b” rather than
“A” and “B,” the caption should too).

12.18  Size and Layout

As a rule, figures should be rectangular with a height : width ratio of 2 : 3 or 3 :
4 (unless such a ratio distorts the data). The scale should be chosen so that the
representation of the data fills the space allotted to it as completely as possible.

Do not use borders around figures. In figures portraying the (x, y) plane, show
only those two axes unless data are also arrayed along a y-axis on the right.

Place tick marks on the outside of the axes (i.e., to the left of the y-axis and
below the x-axis).

Place axis labels close to the axes but not so close that they obscure the scale.
If an axis label applies to more than one panel above or to the right, it need be
given only once (centered with respect to the panels in question).

If the x-axis shows months or years, include the word “Month” or “Year”
under the months or years named. Abbreviate months by their first three
letters; give all four digits for years.

Place multiple panels close together but do not crowd them. Whenever
possible, give them substantive labels (e.g., “Above dam” and “Below dam”)
rather than “A” and “B.”

Place other elements, such as legends (typically used to explain the symbols,
line formats, or shading representing different phenomena), scale bars, and
compass roses within the margins of the figure; if an element applies to more
than one panel, it need be given only once, preferably in the first panel.

Individual lines within a graph may be labeled (such as by an arrow and text,
an equation, or statistical information) as long as the graph does not become
too cluttered.

Whenever possible, use distinct patterns (e.g., hatch marks) rather than
shading to distinguish different phenomena in bar and pie charts; if shading is
used, keep it in the range of 30−70% of black and make sure that the different
shadings are clearly discernable.

In the print version of the journal, all figures will be reproduced in black and
white unless authors have made specific arrangements with the Journals
Department to cover the extra costs of color printing. (In the online version,
color figures will be reproduced in color at no additional charge.) Because
color printing is expensive, authors are advised not to use color to distinguish
phenomena when other means (different shading, symbols, and so forth) are
adequate. If you have to use color in a figure, avoid using similar colors or
shades that may be difficult for readers to distinguish. Also, in deference to
readers with color blindness, avoid using red and green in the same figure.

Maps should include a scale and a compass rose indicating which way is
north. Highly localized maps should be accompanied by a broader-scale map
showing the regional location.

The scale should be given for photomicrographs and, when relevant, for
photographs.

12.19  Lines and Lettering

The axis and other lines appearing in a figure should be wide enough to
accommodate reduction, but not so wide as to dominate the figure. Different
widths may be used to distinguish different items (e.g., axes versus curves),
but the same width should be used for analogous items. Special care should be
taken with dashed lines (which may appear continuous after reduction) and
dotted lines (which may no longer be visible).

Use the font Times Roman for all axis labels; the font size should be 6−9
points after reduction and not bold or italic. Other fonts may be used for other
items as long as (1) the same font is used for analogous items and (2) the font
size is no larger than that used for the axis labels (but at least 6 points).

A bold sans serif font (e.g., Arial) may be used for the letters that distinguish
different panels (A, B, etc.). Otherwise avoid bold type, as it tends to fill in
when reduced. Also avoid italic type, as it tends to wash out.

Capitalize the first word in all labels as well as any proper nouns and
adjectives; do not capitalize other words.

CALL-OUTS

12.20   Call-outs are references to tables, figures, appendices, and supplements that

occur within the main text and direct the reader to those items:

Survival was greater in tank 1 than in tank 2 (Table 1).

All of the tables and figures that appear with the main text should be called out
in numerical order. Call-outs to material in appendices and supplements may
be more general as long as the reader is made aware of them:

(For additional results, refer to Appendix A.1)

Call-outs need not be repeated for every result provided that it is clear in
which table/figure they may be found:

Survival was greater in tank 1 than in tank 2 (Table 1). However, the fish in tank 2
attained greater weight.

13.  Vendors and Commercial Products

13.1

In general, authors are not required to give detailed information about the
commercial products (feeds, chemical compounds, equipment, software, and so
forth) used in their research, but they may do so if they wish.

Authors may format reference to products in whatever way seems best in the situation
at hand. The following formats are all acceptable:

a backpack electrofisher
a backpack electrofisher (Smith-Root)
a backpack electrofisher (Smith-Root; Model 12)
a backpack electrofisher (Smith-Root, Vancouver, Washington)
a backpack electrofisher (Smith-Root, Vancouver, Washington; Model 12)

a Smith-Root backpack electrofisher
a Smith-Root Model 12 backpack electrofisher
a Smith-Root (Vancouver, Washington) backpack electrofisher
a Smith-Root (Vancouver, Washington) Model 12 backpack electrofisher

Terms such as  “Inc.,” “Ltd,” “Corp.,” and “Co.” in company names should be
omitted.

If a commercial product figures prominently in a paper (e.g., when different
products are being compared), the names of the product and producer should be
given at first mention in both the Abstract and the introduction and a complete
identification of the product and producer should be given in Methods:

Eagle’s minimum essential medium (Gibco BRL)   [Abstract and introduction]

Eagle’s minimum essential medium (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, Maryland)   [Methods]

13.2  Subsequent references to a producer may be shortened:

. . . phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, Missouri)   [first mention]

. . . an enzymatic glucose assay (Sigma)   [subsequent mention]

Software

13.3  Software packages should be cited as commercial products or personal
communications, whichever applies, rather than as literature:

  . . . performed with SuperANOVA 4.2 (21st Century Software, Cambridge, Massachusetts).

. . . performed with special software developed by researchers at Utah State University (E. M.
Johnson, personal communication; available at www.usu.edu/zool/habsim/).

In the case of personal communications, indicate whether the software is generally
available.

U.S. Government Disclaimer

13.4  When trade names are given and one or more of the authors is a U.S. Government
employee, the following language should be included in Acknowledgments:

Reference to trade names does not imply endorsement by the U.S. Government.

Similar language should be included for all other employers who request it.

14.  Word Usage

AFS publications restrict the use of certain terms in the interest of ensuring

technical accuracy and not sounding too colloquial. This chapter reviews these
restrictions and addresses other instances of word usage that may cause difficulty.

SPECIFIC TERMS

Affect versus effect.—Except in certain psychological contexts, the word “affect” is a

verb meaning “to have an effect on”; the word “effect,” by contrast, may be either a
noun meaning “result” or a verb meaning “to bring about”:

The slight change in salinity strongly affected the fish.

The slight change in salinity had a strong effect on the fish.

We effected the change in salinity by adding well water to the tanks.

  Alternative versus alternate.—The word “alternative” implies other possibilities:

An alternative explanation for the genetic differences that we observed is the founder effect.

The word “alternate,” by contrast, is a synonym for “opposite” or “every other”:

Dipnetters were stationed on alternate sides of the low-head dam.

The fish were fed on alternate days.

And/or.—The expression “x and/or y” may be used when the meaning is “x or y or

both,” i.e., when x and y can be taken either jointly or separately:

Mortality was caused by higher temperatures and/or oxygen depletion.

In most cases, however, “and” or “or” alone is logically correct. For instance,

Wetland use is subject to state and federal regulations.

is preferable to

Wetland use is subject to state and/or federal regulations.

because even though some wetlands may be subject only to state regulations, some only to
federal regulations, and some to both, wetlands—as a group—are subject to both.

  And versus or in series.—In series, the term “and” should be used to indicate that the
items listed are to be taken together, the term “or” that they are to be taken separately:

The treatments used in this experiment were x, y, and z.

but   Each fish was subjected to one of three treatments: x, y, or  z.

As.—This word may be used to indicate causation:

We terminated sampling early, as the storm had made the lake very choppy.

As such.—Use of this term is restricted to cases in which (1) it is preceded by a description
and (2) the word “such” takes the place of the description in the clause that follows:

The lakes in the study area were all cold, relatively shallow montane lakes; as such, [i.e., as cold,
relatively shallow montane lakes]. . . .

not   The Bonneville Power Administration has jurisdiction over these dams. As such, . . .

In the second example, use “as a result,” “for this reason,” or some equivalent expression to
indicate the connection between the two clauses.

Bias.—When used as a verb, this word should be accompanied by adverbs rather than

adjectives:

biased upward   not   biased high

Compare to versus compare with.—There is an important distinction between the
expressions “compare to” and “compare with”; to compare one thing to another is to
indicate that they are similar in some respect, whereas to compare one thing with another
is simply to examine them side by side:

This situation may be compared to one in which. . . .

We compared the results from the first treatment with those from the second.

In most of the cases encountered in AFS publications, “compare with” is the proper
expression. However, that term should be avoided in actual comparisons:

The fish in the first treatment attained higher weights than those in the second.

not   The fish in the first treatment attained higher weights compared with those in the second.

Comprise.—This word may be used in both passive and active constructions:

The sample comprised fish from 15 species.

      The sample was comprised of fish from 15 species.

Confidence interval versus confidence limits.—The term “confidence interval” refers to a
range of values, the term “confidence limits” to the smallest and largest values within that
range:

within the 95% confidence interval 4.9 ± 0.3

  within the 95% confidence limits 4.6 and 5.2

  Due to.—This term may be used in two senses: (1) as a synonym for “attributable to”
and (2) as a synonym for “owing to” or “because of”:

The poor recruitment in 1997 was probably due to abnormally high predation.

Due to the limitations of our data, we were only able to address the first hypothesis.

Fish versus fishes.—The term “fishes” should only be used as a synonym for “species of

fish,” not as the plural of “fish”:

A large number of fishes are found in this ecosystem.

but   We collected 422 fish by gill netting.

Fishery versus fisheries.—Both terms may be used as adjectives with the same

meaning:

Fishery [Fisheries] management is increasingly focusing on angler behavior.

  Following.—This word may be used as a synonym for “after,” although the latter term is
generally preferable:

After [Following] exposure to the pathogen, the fish. . . .

If versus whether.—Use the word “if” only when the intended meaning is “in the event
of”; use the word “whether” when stating an indirect question with more than one possible
answer:

If hypoxia develops, mortality will rise significantly.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether this type of marking has any
deleterious effects on juvenile fish.

Increased/reduced versus higher/lower.—The terms “increased” and “reduced” may  only
be used in situations in which the researcher has actually altered the variable of  interest;
“higher” and “lower” should be used in other situations:

The increased temperature in the first two tanks during the second phase of the experiment led to. . . .

The lower average temperature in the more northerly of the two creeks was apparently responsible for. . . .

In order to.—Although in rare cases euphony may call for using this term, in most cases
“to” alone will suffice:

To test this hypothesis, we. . . .

not   In order to test this hypothesis, we. . . .

Likely.—This word may be used either as an adjective meaning “probable” or as an

adverb meaning “probably”:

Early spawning is likely.

    Spawning will likely be early.

Over.—This word may be used in the sense of “more than” as well as that of “during”:

We carried out the research over a period of several months.

Over 500 anglers returned completed survey forms.

Parameter.—Although this word has acquired a number of meanings in recent years,
for the sake of clarity AFS style restricts its use to two situations: (1) when it refers to a
fixed value in an equation or statistical distribution and (2) when it refers to a critical
value of some sort:

The estimated parameters were as follows: a = –1.33 and b = 0.59.

A relatively high water temperature (≥26°C) is one of the reproductive parameters for this species.

The term “parameter” should never be used when the term “variable” or, more generally,
“characteristic” is meant:

The most important variable was streamflow.

Potentially.—Avoid using this term with other terms indicating possibility:

This is a potentially important finding.

not   This could be a potentially important finding.

Prior to.—Although euphony may occasionally call for the use of this term, “before” is

a better choice in most cases:

Before the start of the experiment, . . .

not   Prior to the start of the experiment, . . .

Relationship versus relation.—The word “relationship” should be used when referring to

an association or causal connection:

the relationship between substrate type and reproductive success

not   the relation between substrate type and reproductive success

Significant.—With the exception in the second example below, AFS style restricts the use

of this word to cases of statistical significance:

The difference between means was significant (P < 0.05).

Though significant statistically, the result was not considered significant biologically.

In other cases, substitute words such as “major,” “important,” and “substantial” for
“significant.”

Since.—This word may be used as a synonym for “because” as well as in its temporal

sense:

Since the previous research on this question seemed credible, we chose not to replicate it.

Care should be taken to avoid ambiguity, however, as in the phrase

Since the regulations were implemented, . . .

which can be either causative or temporal.

That versus which.—As these terms can have different logical implications, AFS style

prefers to follow the traditional rule of using “that” to introduce dependent clauses and
“which” to introduce independent clauses:

The fish that were moribund. . . . [i.e., only some of the fish were moribund]

The fish, which were moribund, . . . [i.e., all of the fish were moribund]

The.—As a rule, the word “the” should be included whenever the statement refers to a

particular situation as distinct from a general one:

Channel Catfish [in general] are unusual in this regard.

The [particular] Channel Catfish in our study were unusual in this regard.

However, in the abstract, Methods, and other places in which a more condensed form of
expression is desired the word “the” may be omitted from statements referring to
particular situations as long as the context is clear:

We obtained a sample consisting of 298 juvenile Chinook Salmon from the Snake River above Hell’s
Canyon Dam. At the laboratory, fish were weighed (g), measured (mm), and inspected for gross
abnormalities. Fish were then randomly assigned to one of three treatments.

Care must be taken when “the” is used with plurals, however. For instance, the statement

The experts in this area have concluded that. . . .

implies that all of these experts have reached the stated conclusion, which may not be the
case. When it is not, one should state, for instance, that

Some [Many] experts in this area have concluded that. . . .

The word “the” is also required before some place names:

the Atlantic Ocean   the Illinois River   the Appalachian Mountains

but   Antietam Creek   Oneida Lake   McMillen Reservoir   Bonneville Dam   Mount Saint Helens

There is/there are versus exists/exist.—Use the more natural “there is” and “there are”

instead of “exists” and “exist”:

There is conclusive evidence that. . . .

not   Conclusive evidence exists that. . . .

Using.—Traditionally, the use of this term was restricted to sentences in the active

voice in which the agent is clearly specified:

Using a data logger, we obtained data on water temperature.

Through common usage, however, constructions such as

        Data on water temperature were obtained using a data logger.

are now acceptable as long as their meaning is clear.

Where.—This term should be used to introduce a relative clause only when it refers to a

place or other location:

The sites where spawning occurred were. . . .

but   Models in which the reproductive rate is exogenous resulted in. . . .

“Where” may be used to define the variables in an equation, however (see section 4.8)

While.—This term may be used as a synonym for “although” or “whereas” as well as in a

temporal sense:

While the Bluegills were largely unaffected by this change, the White Crappies suffered high
mortality.

With.—AFS style permits “with” to be used as a conjunction; generally, this

construction requires a present participle of the verb:

 Several species were identified, with Green Sunfish being the most numerous.

 not   Several species were identified, with Green Sunfish the most numerous.

OTHER  MATTERS

Voice

AFS style permits authors to use the active voice, the passive voice, or a mixture of the two:

We captured 108 specimens in gill nets deployed at three points within the study section. These
fish were transported to the laboratory with 4 h of capture and. . . .

Verb Tense in Describing Results

  A past tense should be used to describe completed actions:

We sampled the fish at each site every 2 weeks for 3 months.

The present tense should be used to describe general or “enduring” results:

Our data suggest that the spawning period is relatively short for this species.

but   The spawning period was slightly shorter in 1978.

Conditional Terms

Conditional terms are ones that express possibilities as distinct from definite facts;
examples include the terms “perhaps,” “suggests,” and “appears to.” As a rule, there
should be only one such term per sentence:

These results suggest that Black Crappies are. . . .

not   These results suggest that Black Crappies may be. . . .

Singular versus Plural with Variables

Unless the context clearly calls for a plural, terms referring to variables should be in the
singular:

Temperature was recorded at all study sites.

but   Temperatures were compared across study sites.

Quantitative Comparisons

Expressions such as

Mortality was four times greater in the second treatment than in the first.

should be avoided because they are ambiguous; logically, the expression “four times
greater” means “five times as great,” whereas most authors mean “four times as great.”

In the same vein, the term “times” should be avoided in describing decreases:

The treatment value was one-fourth that of the control.

not   The treatment value was four times lower than that of the control.

  Also avoid using vague comparative terms:

Small fish (<78 mm) suffered greater mortality than larger ones.

not   Smaller fish suffered greater mortality than larger ones.

Appendix A.  Spelling List

This appendix shows the treatment of technical terms that are encountered frequently in
AFS publications. There are two lists, one for terms relating to mathematics and statistics
and one for other terms. Parts of speech are abbreviated as follows: adj =  adjective,
adv =  adverb, n = noun, and v = verb. Superscripted numerals refer to notes at the end of
the appendix.

The sources for the second list are abbreviated as follows: W11 = Merriam-Webster’s
Collegiate Dictionary, 11th edition; W3 = Webster’s Third New International Dictionary
(but not W11); and CMS = Chicago Manual of Style, 15th edition.

Notes

In the following notes the term “open” refers to a compound word in which
the  components are separated by spaces (e.g., “point source”) and the term
“closed” to a compound word in which the components are not separated by
spaces (e.g., “warmwater”).

1.  decision maker, x maker: Most compounds involving “maker” are

open, but  “policymaker” is an important exception.

2.  decision making; x-ing: Temporary compounds formed from a noun and a

gerund are generally open as nouns, but many permanent compounds are closed
(e.g.,  bookkeeping). Adjectival compounds formed from a noun and a present
participle are  hyphenated before the nouns they modify (e.g., decision-making
event), and a few permanent compounds are hyphenated after the noun as well
(e.g., thought-provoking).

3.   early: When used as an adjective, “early” can  be hyphenated (e.g., early-life
behavior). However, it may be better to rewrite some phrases (e.g., to use the
adverbial form “early migrating salmon” instead of the adjectival form  “early-
migrant salmon”). Phrases such  as “early life history” are not hyphenated
because combinations like “life history” and  “life stage” are treated as compound
nouns (i.e., “early” modifies “life history”).

4.  generating plant, generating station: These terms are open compound nouns, so
modifiers preceding “generating” are not followed by hyphens (e.g., power
generating station, electricity generating plant). (Note: A nuclear plant is not
always a nuclear power generating plant [e.g., the Savannah River site produces
nuclear material for defense rather than electricity]).

5.   fin fold, lateral line: Names of body parts should be treated as open compound

nouns and not hyphenated when used as adjectives.

6.  mid, middepth, etc.:  The word “mid” can be treated as an adjective, but AFS

generally prefers to treat it as a prefix (e.g., midseason, midyear). It is
hyphenated when it modifies a proper noun, date, or number (e.g., mid-August,
mid-1988). If it is separated from its stem by other words, it can stand alone
(e.g., mid to late March but early to mid-March).

7.  x-year-olds: There is some inconsistency in Webster’s dictionaries with

respect to these terms. AFS uses the hyphenated form for the noun as well as
the adjective.

8.  cold brand, freeze brand: Although many compound nouns with the word

“freeze” are  hyphenated in Webster’s dictionaries, nearly all compound nouns
with the word “cold” are open; AFS has therefore chosen to leave all such terms
open. Most compound  nouns with the word “freezing” are open (e.g., freezing
point), but most of the  adjectival forms have hyphens (e.g., freezing-point
measurement).

9.  mass mark, etc: Webster’s dictionaries leave most compounds with “mass” open

when they are nouns but hyphenate the adjectival and verb forms.

10. purse-seine: The verb form is hyphenated for clarity, even though most of the

verbs pertaining to capture techniques are closed (e.g., gillnet).

11. B cell, R plasmid, T cell: All cytological entities designated by a capital letter

should  be left open as nouns and adjectives (e.g., T cell deficiency, B leukocyte
measurements) unless treated otherwise in W11 or hyphens are needed because
of  the construction (e.g., T-cell-dependent antigens).

12. radio tag, etc.: Webster’s dictionaries close up all “radio” prefixes when they
refer to  radioactivity. When the reference is to the radio frequency spectrum,
most such terms are open as nouns.

13. non-yolk-bearing, pre-yolk-sac: When a prefix is added to a hyphenated

word, a hyphen should come after the prefix.

14. year-class: W3 lists “year class” as a noun, the only instance of an open “-class”

or “- group” term. For editorial consistency, AFS hyphenates this term as a noun.

15. carbon-14, cobalt-60, uranium-235: Although these isotopes are open in W11,
the standard practice in scientific writing is to place a hyphen between the
spelled-out element name and the mass number. When the element symbol is
used, the number should be a superscript placed before the symbol (e.g.,

P).

32

16. first-order, second-growth: All rank-order compound adjectives are hyphenated.

17. age-group, size-group, length-cohort; type x, x-type: Do not hyphenate adjectives
of the forms “type x” and “group x” unless hyphenation is needed for clarity.

Hyphenate all compound nouns and adjectives that end in “cohort,” “group,” or
“type.”

18. x boat, xboat: Many boat types are open (e.g., charter boat, drift boat); others

are closed (e.g., headboat, johnboat, motorboat, and speedboat). Open
compounds can either be left open or hyphenated when used as adjectives.

19. angler-day, angler-hour, net-day; x-day, x-hour, x-kilometer, x-mile: Use a

hyphen in these rate or effort terms and in specialized units of measure such as
light-year (distance) and acre-foot (volume).

20. brood year, water year, etc.: These noun–noun combinations are measures of
time (although they may be different from the calendar year); they are not
efforts or rates  (e.g., angler-hour) or units of measure (e.g., light-year), and like
“fiscal year,” they are left open as nouns and adjectives.

21. bleb-like, virus-like; xlike: Words formed with the suffix “like” are generally

closed. However, “bleb-like” and “virus-like” are hyphenated for clarity and to
follow common usage in the fish health literature.

22. ecosystem-wide; xwide: Words with the suffix “wide” are generally closed;
however, CMS allows them to be hyphenated if the root word is long or of
several (more than  two) syllables (thus “ecosystem-wide” but “systemwide”).

23. compact disc, disc brakes, etc.: There is considerable variation in W11 in the
use of  “disk” versus “disc,” the former appearing to be the preferred spelling
for most  noncomputer terms except “disc brakes.” Use “disk” for electronic
storage media and  “disc” for optical and video storage media, and follow the
dictionary for other words.

24. air bladder, gas bladder, swim bladder: These open compounds refer to the
hydrostatic organ present in most fish. “Air bladder” and “gas bladder” are
preferable to “swim  bladder.” “Air sac” should be reserved for the air-filled
space in birds.

25. length frequency, weight frequency: In keeping with the move toward not
hyphenating noun–noun combinations used as adjectives, AFS no longer
enforces its previous  standard of hyphenating x-frequency words when they are
used as adjectives. Hyphenated forms are acceptable, however.

Appendix C. Plurals of Fish Names

The plurals of most fish names are formed by adding the letters s or es (with
stem changes as appropriate) to the singular. In a few cases, however, the
plural is the same as the singular or more than one plural is acceptable.
