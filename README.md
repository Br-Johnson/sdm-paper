# Salmon Data Stewardship Article

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our journal article draft:  
**"Best practices and practical applications for salmon data mobilization—a guide for salmon biologists assuming responsibility for data stewardship"**

This repo hosts the manuscript in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) format and provides a transparent, collaborative space to refine the paper before journal submission.

## 📖 Project Overview

Salmon biologists and data managers across agencies and institutions collect vast amounts of data—but much of it remains siloed, undocumented, or difficult to reuse. This article aims to provide practical, actionable guidance for improving salmon data stewardship practices. We highlight common challenges, propose a set of best practices, and offer a case study illustrating the real-world impact of good (and bad) data stewardship.

We also maintain several appendices that can serve as living documents beyond the article.

Please contribute to the appendices!

Appendix 1: we are accumulating and maintaining real world examples of these best practices in action. Please contribute your own examples or suggest improvements to existing ones.

Appendix 2: A training roadmap for biologists assuming responsibility for data stewardship, including links to existing resources and training materials.

## 🚀 Goals

- Identify core challenges in managing and sharing salmon data.
- Propose a concise and field-tested set of best practices for data stewardship.
- Present a reproducible, FAIR, and CARE-aligned vision for salmon data infrastructure.
- Support the professionalization of the data stewardship role within fisheries science.

## 🛠 Repository Structure
