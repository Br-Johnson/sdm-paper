# Salmon Data Stewardship Manuscript

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our journal article draft:  
**"Best practices and practical applications for salmon data mobilization‚Äîa guide for salmon biologists assuming responsibility for data stewardship"**

This repo hosts the manuscript in Quarto format and provides a transparent, collaborative space to refine the paper before journal submission. You can read the paper here: https://br-johnson.github.io/sdm-paper/ or download the latest version in Word Doc format here: https://github.com/Br-Johnson/sdm-paper/raw/refs/heads/main/docs/index.docx

## üìñ Project Overview

Salmon biologists and data managers across agencies and institutions collect vast amounts of data‚Äîbut much of it remains siloed, undocumented, or difficult to reuse. This article aims to provide practical, actionable guidance for improving salmon data stewardship practices. 

We also maintain several appendices that can serve as living documents beyond the article.

Please contribute to the appendices!

Appendix 1: we are accumulating and maintaining real world examples of these best practices in action. Please contribute your own examples or suggest improvements to existing ones.

Appendix 2:?? A training roadmap for biologists assuming responsibility for data stewardship, including links to existing resources and training materials.
