  <title>Abstract</title>
  <p>Salmon research, management and conservation generates increasingly
  vast and diverse data crucial for effective decision making for
  resource management. Yet, these resources remain largely fragmented
  across jurisdictions, disciplines and outdated infrastructures,
  limiting their use in responsive fisheries management. Biologists are
  increasingly assuming the responsibilities of data stewards to address
  these challenges, yet often lack clear guidance or institutional
  support to do so. We provide practical guidance for those
  transitioning into these essential stewardship roles, outlining
  actionable best practices specific to the salmon research and
  management domain, and argue that effective salmon management hinges
  upon formally establishing data stewardship as a dedicated,
  institutionally supported professional role. We outline key best
  practices —including both socio-cultural and technical solutions that
  collectively ensure salmon data meet FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
  Interoperable, Reusable) principles and respect Indigenous Data
  Sovereignty. Through an illustrative case study involving sockeye
  salmon productivity analyses across Pacific Coast jurisdictions, we
  highlight how clearly defined stewardship practices can enhance data
  reproducibility, integration, and management efficacy. With a
  foundation of shared best practices, salmon data stewards will enable
  faster, more transparent decisions that draw from broader,
  cross-jurisdictional datasets, and support development of tools that
  leverage recent advances in artificial intelligence—ultimately
  strengthening the management and conservation of salmon
  populations.</p>

  <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
  <p>Salmon biologists generate vast amounts of data on abundance,
  health, and environmental conditions, yet these data remain
  fragmented, inconsistently measured, and often incomplete across time,
  space, and life history stages—limiting their value for robust
  research, hypothesis evaluation, and management decision-making
  (<xref alt="Marmorek et al. 2011" rid="ref-marmorek2011" ref-type="bibr">Marmorek
  et al. 2011</xref>;
  <xref alt="Inman et al. 2021" rid="ref-inman2021" ref-type="bibr">Inman

  <xref alt="diack2024?" rid="ref-diack2024" ref-type="bibr"><bold>diack2024?</bold></xref>).
  Salmon traverse multiple ecological regions and jurisdictional
  boundaries, resulting in data collections managed by diverse agencies
  and institutions, often in isolation. This fragmented data landscape
  undermines timely, integrated analyses necessary for effective
  management and conservation decisions. Additionally, the lack of
  institutional support and dedicated roles for data management
  frequently relegates critical data stewardship tasks to an ad hoc
  status—something performed off the side of a biologist’s desk.
  Institutional neglect of formal data stewardship has become a
  bottleneck in adaptive salmon management and conservation efforts.</p>
  <p>The growing complexity of fisheries management, combined with
  escalating environmental uncertainties due to climate change, demands
  rapid, integrated, and robust data analyses
  (<xref alt="Bull et al. 2022" rid="ref-bull2022" ref-type="bibr">Bull
  et al. 2022</xref>). Yet salmon biologists transitioning into data
  stewardship roles typically receive insufficient guidance or
  institutional support. We argue that fisheries management agencies
  must formally acknowledge and fund dedicated data stewardship roles to
  effectively mobilize and leverage salmon data. Without this
  institutional commitment, data remain inaccessible and fragmented,
  severely constraining the responsiveness and adaptability of
  management actions. To address these critical shortcomings, we outline
  practical steps that biologists, agencies and organizations can
  adopt.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="the-problem">
  <title>THE PROBLEM</title>
  <p>Effective integration and mobilization of salmon data mirrors the
  complexity of salmon biology itself: these fish traverse freshwater,
  estuarine, and marine ecosystems, crossing provincial, state, tribal,
  federal, and international management boundaries
  (<xref alt="Groot and Margolis 1991" rid="ref-groot1991" ref-type="bibr">Groot
  and Margolis 1991</xref>). While localized successes in data
  coordination exist—particularly within regional fisheries management
  offices and treaty commissions—salmon data integrated across agencies
  for each phase of the salmon life cycle is rare and prohibitively
  expensive for all but the most pressing challenges. Most salmon
  datasets remain confined within institutional silos, often
  undocumented, stored in outdated systems, or formatted according to
  internal standards that are incompatible with broader integration
  efforts. As a result, long-term datasets critical to stock assessment
  and environmental monitoring frequently become inaccessible, poorly
  understood, or effectively lost once original data holders retire or
  move on.</p>
  <p>This fragmentation is compounded by the number of disciplines and
  organizations involved. Geneticists, oceanographers, freshwater
  ecologists, stock assessment biologists, and fisheries managers all
  contribute data using their own field-specific conventions and
  workflows. Meanwhile, data is distributed across federal, state,
  provincial, tribal, and academic institutions—each with its own
  mandates, technologies, and metadata requirements. Many salmon
  data-holding organizations rely on aging infrastructure or opaque,
  undocumented standards that lag behind modern open-science practices.
  This tangle of disciplinary and institutional fragmentation slows
  integration, hinders reproducibility, and delays analyses that could
  otherwise inform time-sensitive management decisions. Modernizing
  these systems will require coordinated investment, grounded in shared
  international data standards and stewardship practices that
  accommodate the full disciplinary and geographic diversity of salmon
  science.</p>
  <p>The consequences of inaction are already visible. When critical
  datasets are hard to find, access, or interpret, biologists and
  analysts lose valuable time trying to reconstruct or harmonize them.
  This reduces transparency, increases the risk of errors, and delays
  urgent conservation or management responses. Without clear
  accountability for data stewardship, the system continues to rely on
  improvised, inconsistent, and ultimately unsustainable practices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="the-need-for-coordinated-action">
  <title>THE NEED FOR COORDINATED ACTION</title>
  <p>For fisheries managers, modernizing data systems and workflows is
  essential to improve the quality, speed, and interoperability of
  operational data assets. These systems must support an increasingly
  complex decision-making landscape that now depends on integrating
  broader types and sources of data, often in real time. At the same
  time, researchers face pressure to generate insights on future salmon
  abundance, the impacts of changing environmental conditions, and the
  effectiveness of restoration strategies across all salmon life stages.
  Yet the current scattered and siloed data landscape remains unfit for
  purpose—both for science and for management.</p>
  <p>Despite operating under different mandates, both researchers and
  managers struggle to align their data with community-agreed principles
  such as FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable)
  (<xref alt="Wilkinson et al. 2016" rid="ref-wilkinson2016" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson
  et al. 2016</xref>) and Indigenous Data Sovereignty frameworks like
  the CARE principles (Collective Authority, Responsibility, and Ethics)
  (<xref alt="Carroll, Rodriguez-Lonebear, and Martinez 2019" rid="ref-carroll2019" ref-type="bibr">Carroll,
  Rodriguez-Lonebear, and Martinez 2019</xref>;
  <xref alt="Jennings et al. 2023" rid="ref-jennings2023a" ref-type="bibr">Jennings
  et al. 2023</xref>). Adhering to CARE data management principles is
  all the more important when it comes to salmon related data given the
  socio-cultural importance of salmon to the Indigenous communities of
  the Northern Pacific and Trans-Atlantic
  (<xref alt="Ween and Colombi 2013" rid="ref-ween2013" ref-type="bibr">Ween
  and Colombi 2013</xref>;
  <xref alt="Earth Economics 2021" rid="ref-eartheconomics2021" ref-type="bibr">Earth
  Economics 2021</xref>). Large volumes of data collected through
  long-term monitoring programs hold tremendous value, especially for
  secondary users—but are often inaccessible due to a lack of time,
  resources, and incentives for data producers to publish them
  (<xref alt="LINDENMAYER et al. 2012" rid="ref-lindenmayer2012" ref-type="bibr">LINDENMAYER
  et al. 2012</xref>). Without clear support and guidance,
  well-intentioned practitioners are left with ad hoc approaches that
  limit reuse and interoperability. This gap can only be bridged by
  equipping both data producers and stewards with tools, support, and
  institutional backing to publish interoperable, machine-readable
  metadata and datasets in alignment with shared principles.</p>
  <p>A coordinated approach to stewarding salmon data should follow
  established open science standards and adhere explicitly to FAIR
  principles, tailored specifically for salmon research and management
  (<xref alt="Johnson and Stap 2024" rid="ref-johnson2024" ref-type="bibr">Johnson
  and Stap 2024</xref>). Achieving meaningful interoperability demands
  both breadth and depth. <bold>Broad interoperability</bold> integrates
  diverse scientific domains, systems, and formats, requiring
  structured, machine-readable data and metadata published openly for
  maximum discoverability. <bold>Deep interoperability</bold> demands
  precise definitions of salmon-specific terms and methods, ensuring
  data remains meaningful and usable across contexts. Salmon data
  stewards can improve conservation outcomes for salmon by coordinating
  across boundaries to develop a shared foundation of data stewardship
  practices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="defining-data-stewardship-in-salmon-management">
  <title>DEFINING DATA STEWARDSHIP IN SALMON MANAGEMENT</title>
  <p>Data stewardship encompasses the coordinated practices, roles, and
  responsibilities necessary to effectively manage, share, and reuse
  data throughout its lifecycle. Within fisheries science, stewardship
  involves ensuring data quality, compliance with agreed-upon standards,
  and the establishment of clear governance to guide data collection,
  documentation, integration, and preservation. However, salmon data
  stewardship goes beyond mere technical data management; it involves
  actively facilitating collaboration, communication, and
  consensus-building among data producers and users across multiple
  institutions and jurisdictions.</p>
  <p>Specifically, effective salmon data stewards perform several
  critical functions:</p>
  <list list-type="bullet">
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Technical oversight</bold>: Ensuring metadata
      completeness, adherence to standardized terminologies and
      vocabularies, and robust quality assurance protocols.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Social and organizational facilitation</bold>: Leading
      stakeholder engagement, capacity-building activities, and
      negotiation of data access and sharing agreements, including
      addressing Indigenous Peoples’ rights and interests in data
      governance.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
      <p><bold>Institutional advocacy</bold>: Championing the
      institutional recognition of data stewardship roles, promoting
      sustained investment and dedicated resources for data management
      infrastructure and practices.</p>
    </list-item>
  </list>
  <p>A user-centered design approach to salmon data stewardship is
  critical and focuses on creating tools that align with biologists’
  needs. Data stewards play a critical role as business analysts,
  bridging the gap between biologists and IT by translating data needs
  into application or data system features. When data management is
  separated from biologists, accountability weakens, and quality issues
  go unnoticed. While IT expertise is essential for infrastructure and
  security, effective data system design requires IT to act as an
  enabler, rather than gatekeeper, provisioning self-serve data
  infrastructure. The Data Steward, serving as a translator between IT
  and biologists, enables biologists to engage independently with data
  systems, fostering ownership and accountability and ultimately
  improving data quality for research and management.</p>
  <p>Dedicated stewardship roles empower salmon biologists to bridge
  disciplinary divides and jurisdictional barriers, transforming
  fragmented datasets into cohesive, interoperable resources. By
  proactively defining, implementing, and maintaining data standards and
  workflows, salmon data stewards create conditions for timely,
  accurate, and reproducible analyses. Such stewardship positions salmon
  biologists to better inform adaptive management decisions, ultimately
  strengthening salmon conservation and resilience.</p>

  <title>CASE STUDY — UPDATING PACIFIC WIDE SOCKEYE PRODUCTIVITY: WHAT
  AGENCIES COULD DO NOW</title>
  <p>This case study revisits a pacific coast wide sockeye productivity
  dataset assembled from diverse agency sources by academic researchers
  (<xref alt="Peterman and Dorner 2012" rid="ref-peterman2012" ref-type="bibr">Peterman
  and Dorner 2012</xref>). We reflect not on the significant work the
  research team accomplished, but rather on the preventable
  institutional and technical barriers that impeded their work—and
  continue to burden data updates and reuse efforts today. Their study
  examined productivity trends across 64 sockeye salmon stocks spanning
  Washington, British Columbia (B.C.), and Alaska. However, attempting
  to replicate or build upon this analysis today is an arduous,
  time-consuming, and error-prone endeavour due to fragmented data
  sources, inconsistent formats, and lack of standardized practices
  among the key institutions involved: the Washington Department of Fish
  and Wildlife (WDFW), Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), and the Alaska
  Department of Fish and Game (ADF&amp;G).</p>
  <p>Each section below highlights a key challenge faced by the team and
  proposes practical steps based on our best practices that data-holding
  agencies could do to enable easier integration, validation, and
  updating of salmon datasets across jurisdictions and decades. This
  case study illustrates how implementing the foundational concepts and
  practical recommendations outlined in this paper can transform data
  stewardship practices within these organizations. By doing so, they
  can significantly enhance data accessibility, quality, and
  interoperability—ultimately enabling more efficient and accurate
  analyses that support salmon conservation and management.</p>

    <title>Challenge 1: Interpreting the Data — What do these numbers
    actually mean?</title>
    <p>Peterman’s team frequently worked with datasets that lacked basic
    contextual information. Fields such as “year,” “return,” or “age
    class” were often undefined or inconsistently used. For example,
    some datasets recorded returns by calendar year while others used
    brood year, and few included metadata to clarify the distinction. In
    many cases, the team had to reconstruct metadata by back-checking
    against reports or simulating assumptions (e.g., about age
    structure) to interpret the data correctly.</p>

    <p>The Peterman dataset was compiled from multiple files scattered
    across email inboxes, regional offices, and gray literature. Data
    were stored in inconsistent formats, lacked clear versioning, and
    were difficult to discover outside of specific research networks.
    Even today, no API or structured access mechanism exists to update
    or query the data programmatically. As a result, researchers hoping
    to build on the dataset may have to start from scratch.</p>

    <p>Once Peterman and his team completed their analysis, no formal
    plan existed for sustaining or updating the dataset. Responsibility
    for ongoing maintenance fell informally to former students and
    collaborators. Despite its national and international relevance, the
    dataset was never adopted by an agency as a living product.
    Moreover, the original data contributors often lacked incentives,
    support, or recognition for their efforts—conditions that persist in

    <p>While the analytical contribution of the Peterman productivity
    dataset remains significant, the barriers encountered in compiling,

    challenges are not unique to Peterman’s team—they reflect systemic
    gaps in data governance, documentation, infrastructure, and
    incentives. By adopting the seven best practices outlined above,
    agencies and researchers can transform legacy datasets into living
    resources, enabling reproducibility, easing collaboration, and
    accelerating insight across the salmon research and management

    <title>CONCLUSION</title>
    <p>We envision a future where salmon data are not locked in filing
    cabinets, buried in PDFs, or hidden in siloed spreadsheets, but
    instead flow seamlessly through a well-stewarded digital ecosystem.
    In this future, field biologists, Indigenous guardians, modelers,
    and policymakers interact with a living knowledge system—one that is
    transparent, discoverable, interoperable, and constantly evolving.
    Metadata standards, controlled vocabularies, and shared governance
    frameworks are not afterthoughts but integral to the culture of data
    collection and use. Scientists receive credit for publishing
    high-quality data, and users trust the provenance and structure of
    the datasets they rely on to make critical management decisions.</p>
    <p>The process of aggregating and understanding salmon data has been
    fraught with challenges, from the complex life histories of the
    species, changing habitat conditions, and human effects to the
    jurisdictional and institutional silos that obstruct coordination.
    Salmon traverse political and ecosystem boundaries, yet our data
    systems often do not. The need of the hour is a strategy that is
    simple, flexible, and coordinated—one that embraces the FAIR
    principles while integrating the CARE principles to honor the
    sovereignty and knowledge systems of Indigenous communities.</p>
    <p>In the face of accelerating environmental change and rapid
    technological innovation, a transformative opportunity exists: to
    harness fragmented and heterogeneous datasets and translate them
    into standardized, interoperable data products. These
    products—rooted in community-endorsed standards and supported by
    persistent infrastructure—will allow researchers and resource
    managers to adopt data-intensive analytical approaches, automate
    updates to population indicators, and integrate diverse datasets
    into real-time decision-support tools. This marks a critical step
    toward transitioning salmon science into the “Fourth Paradigm” of
    discovery(<xref alt="Hey 2012" rid="ref-hey2012" ref-type="bibr">Hey
    2012</xref>): one driven by data-intensive, cross-disciplinary
    synthesis.</p>
