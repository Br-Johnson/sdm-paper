title: Broad vs deep interoperability (conceptual spine)
intent: >
  Clarify the paper’s conceptual distinction between broad interoperability (exchange + discovery)
  and deep interoperability (preserving meaning for integration + reanalysis).
audience: Salmon biologists; data stewards; interdisciplinary collaborators

    title: "Broad interoperability"
    bullets:
      - "Structured formats + machine-readable metadata"
      - "Clear access conditions (FAIR ≠ open-by-default)"
      - "Persistent identifiers and stable landing pages"
      - "Trusted repositories / catalogs and search indexing"
    footer: "Without this: people cannot reliably find or retrieve data products."
  deep:
    title: "Deep interoperability"
    bullets:
      - "Shared definitions for terms, methods, and units"
      - "Controlled vocabularies + ontology-backed identifiers"
      - "Mappings/crosswalks across programs and jurisdictions"
      - "Provenance and versioning for reanalysis over time"
    footer: "Without this: data may be accessible but meaning drifts and integration fails."

composition:
  recommended_structure: "two stacked panels (top=broad, bottom=deep)"
  notes:
    - "Make the contrast obvious in grayscale via subtle fill difference."
    - "Keep bullets short; no more than 4 each."
