title: Seven Practices for Salmon Data Stewardship (Blueprint)
intent: >
  Provide a one-page, skimmable “anchor” graphic that names the seven practices,
  shows that metadata governance is cross-cutting, and cues FAIR/CARE as guiding principles.
audience: Interdisciplinary fisheries scientists, managers, data stewards

  practices:
    - id: Practice::DataGovernance
      label: "1. Data Governance"
      one_liner: "Clarify roles, decision rights, and agreements for shared data products."
    - id: Practice::ReuseInfrastructure
      label: "2. Reuse Infrastructure"
      one_liner: "Adopt proven repositories, catalogs, and tooling instead of bespoke systems."
    - id: Practice::PersistentIdentifiers
      label: "3. Persistent Identifiers (PIDs)"
      one_liner: "Make data, people, and outputs citable and linked (e.g., DOI, ORCID)."
    - id: Practice::SharedDataModels
      label: "4. Shared Data Models & Vocabularies"
      one_liner: "Use shared schemas, controlled terms, and ontologies to enable integration."
    - id: Practice::AccessibleStorage
      label: "5. Accessible Storage & Analysis"
      one_liner: "Store data in trusted, structured ways others can access, use, and trust."
    - id: Practice::IncentivizeSharing
      label: "6. Incentivize & Track Sharing"
      one_liner: "Enable credit, metrics, and visibility to sustain contributions and reuse."
    - id: Practice::CommunityBuilding
      label: "7. Community Building"
      one_liner: "Co-develop standards and workflows across jurisdictions and communities."
  cross_cutting:
    - id: CrossCutting::MetadataGovernance
      label: "Metadata governance (cross-cutting)"
      one_liner: "Continuous documentation, QA, and stewardship of meaning across the lifecycle."
  principles_callout:
    id: Principles::FAIR_CARE
    label: "Guiding principles"
    items:
      - "FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)"
      - "CARE (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, Ethics)"

composition:
  recommended_structure: "7-card stack + cross-cutting band"
  notes:
    - "Prefer a clean card stack (print-friendly) over a wheel."
    - "Use subtle grayscale hierarchy (stroke/weight/spacing) over color dependence."
    - "Keep each one-liner ≤ ~12 words where possible; wrap to 2 lines max."
