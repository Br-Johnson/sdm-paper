# Figures

This folder keeps figure specs and exported figure assets versioned alongside the manuscript.

## Active path (Blueprint figure)

- Spec (ground truth): `figures/specs/fig-blueprint-seven-practices.yml`
- Figma MCP prompt (copilot workflow): `figures/figma/mcp-prompts/fig-blueprint-seven-practices.md`

## Export conventions

- Prefer vector masters: `SVG` and/or `PDF` with text preserved as text.
- Avoid screenshots.
- If raster is required by the journal, export `TIFF` at high DPI (e.g., 600) and verify legibility after reduction.
